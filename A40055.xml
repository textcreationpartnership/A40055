            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author of theſe Sermons, having ſerved his time, and being fallen aſleepe, before their time came to looke out, and doe ſervice in the world; I conceived it might beare the conſtruction of a peece of ſome light charitie to lead them out in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan-like condition by the hand of a recommendatorie Epiſtle into the world. Men
<pb facs="tcp:108344:3"/> for the moſt part deſire in Bookes, to know firſt what is ſaid of them, before they care to know what they ſay; and ſometimes an Author worthy of prime inſpection, for want of an Agent to make his worth his harbenger, may lie as long neglected and unread, as the poore Cripple at the poole of <hi>Bethſaida</hi> lay uncured for want of one to caſt him into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>The ſubject (indeed) here principally diſcourſed, and brought out of darkneſſe into light (Chriſtian mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſeemeth to diſdaine all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, and petitioning for it, it being of ſo great weight and
<pb facs="tcp:108344:3"/> tranſcendent importance, that it commands all hearts and eyes to looke up unto it; and threatens with power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from on high, even the greateſt on earth that ſhall turne their backe, and not their face upon it.</p>
            <p>There are three things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially (among others) that will ſay well to make this rough and hidden way of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſmooth and plaine. The firſt is, the greatneſſe of the Author, and founder of that honourable order of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and who was the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preſident of it himſelfe; Even the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: the apprehenſion and ſenſe of
<pb facs="tcp:108344:4"/> ſuch fellowſhip with us in our way, cannot but devoure and drowne all ſenſe and thought of what otherwiſe might be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and diſtaſtfull in it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romans, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall being ſlaine in the battell, there was ſcarce any Souldier that regarded his life; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of it, for ſuch a death, wherein hee might beare his Generall company; and if any did returne home alive, in ſuch a caſe there was a brand of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie ſet upon him ever after. The truth is, were not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſin, and the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of unbeliefe in the world at hand to qualifie the matter,
<pb facs="tcp:108344:4"/> and give ſatisfaction; it were the moſt aſtoniſhing wonder that ever the world ſaw, that Ieſus Chriſt being dead, the whole world ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſolve to die with him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the greatneſſe of the helpe, or mighty arme of aſsiſtance that is ready to joyne with us in this great worke of mortification if our hearts bee once ſet upon it: this is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God and of Chriſt; <hi>If you mortifie the deeds of the body by the ſpirit, you ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8. This Spirit of God reſiding and dwelling in thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, to whom hee is given, is alway at hand, ready; yea, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and longing to bee ſet on

And being ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, and ſet on to purpoſe, it carries on his worke before him with an high hand, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king havock and deſolation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fleſhly luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the ſoule. The greateſt and moſt difficulteſt undertakings, and ſuch which the ſoule of man would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe abhorre, and turne aſide from altogether, are yet dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and carried on with a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and pleaſantneſſe of hope, when a man ſees meaſure for meaſure,

Mortification can bee no other, but a ſolid delight and ſpirituall recreation to him, that duly and deeply conſiders what oddes and advantage hee hath of his enemie, the fleſh, by the partaking, and cloſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:108344:6"/> of that bleſſed friend of his, the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt is, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which the God of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences (as the Scripture ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him) hath ſealed and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by purpoſe and promiſe, both Yea and Amen upon this worke of Mortification. If wee be dead with Chriſt we beleeve, that is, wee eaſily beleeve, or have ground ſufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that wee ſhall live with him, as the foundation of the enſuing diſcourſe proclaimes aloud to the world: where by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with Chriſt is not meant of an everlaſting being in his preſence only (though his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb facs="tcp:108344:6"/> alone be a Paradiſe of joy and bleſſedneſs in abundance) but an admittance or taking up into an in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e communion with him in all his glory; or as himſelfe is pleaſed with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.21. a ſitting downe with him upon his Throne. Men for the moſt part can bee content that any man ſhould chuſe or appoint their worke for them, if it might bee permitted to themſelves to chooſe their wages, and have good ſecuritie for it: Who would refuſe with <hi>Sampſon</hi> to encounter Lyons, if they could be ſecured to eate honey out of their carkaſſes? Who would not have caſt in his lot with
<pb facs="tcp:108344:7"/> thoſe three faithfull ſervants of GOD, and have beene content to have taken part with them in that hotte ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the fierie furnace, could they have beene ſatisfie for their ſafe comming off with their lives untouched, and like advancement afterward in the Kingdome? Low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ſlender recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make even light worke heavie; the only way to drowne the ſowerneſſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſantneſſe of any taske, is to make it ſwimme in an Ocean of reward. It is a principle in reaſon, <hi>Finis dat amabilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem mediis,</hi> Good ends make hard wayes or meanes lovely
<pb facs="tcp:108344:7"/> and deſireable. If Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had as bitter and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable an oppoſition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie to nature, as the grave it ſelfe, yet the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent vaſtneſſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that ſame farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, eternall weight of glory (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had much adoe to bring out his notion of it in words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſſe, and leaving ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what behinde, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.17.) dearely apprehended and beleeved, mightily and effectuouſly conſidered, is able fully to reconcile the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
            <p>I am loth to exceed the time and meaſure of an Epiſtle. The
<pb facs="tcp:108344:8"/> nature, neceſsitie and meanes of this great Maſter-peece of Mortification with ſome other things of Affinitie with them, are well laid down in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons following; Some ſtraines (I beleeve) thou wilt meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that have beene ſtrangers to thee heretofore, and which will doe lively execution, and quit themſelves like the words of the wiſe, whoſe propertie is (as the wiſe man informes) to be as goades or nailes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſtned. Holy and learned men (amongſt whom not to number wer doubtleſſe to injure much mine Author) are not to bee too deeply char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or too troubleſomely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated
<pb facs="tcp:108344:8"/> with for ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of expreſsions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in perhaps they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more ſatisfaction than others: And indeed it is a hard thing for any man to write ſo ſavourly or warily, but that the Reader hath need ſtill to bring a graine of ſalt with him to make the nouriſhment whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He aime and ſcope of the Apoſtle in this place,<note place="margin">Scope of the words.</note> is by the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an objection propoſed verſe 1. to ſhew the neceſſary co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with juſtification. The objection is this, If where ſinne hath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108344:14"/> abounded, grace doth much more abound, (which the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes in the former Chapter, treating of free juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by grace) then ſaith the carnaliſt, <hi>let us continue in ſinne that grace may abound:</hi> this is the objection.</p>
            <p>To this the Apoſtle anſwers two wayes.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, by way of deteſtation.</item>
               <item>Secondly, by way of confutation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>By way of deteſtation in the beginning of the ſecond verſe, <hi>God forbid:</hi> farre be it from ſuch gracious premiſes, to make ſo dangerous and peſtilent an inference; What, ſaith he, <hi>ſhall we continue in ſinne that grace may abound? God forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, by way of confutation, and that by a double argument, anſwerable to the two parts of Sanctification; Mortification, and Vivification, both of them pregnant, and full of ſinewes to enforce, and preſſe the cauſe and concluſion in hand.</p>
            <p>The firſt argument is thus, ſuch as are dead to ſinne with Chriſt, they cannot wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wilingly live and continue in ſinne, but ſuch as are juſtified from their ſinnes by Chriſt, they are dead to ſinne with Chriſt; therefore ſuch as are juſtified by Chriſt they cannot live, and continue in ſinne. The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> propoſition the Apoſtle proves. Firſt by the efficacie of baptiſme verſ. 4. and 5.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108344:14"/> and by conformitie to Chriſt, in his crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſufferings verſe 6.</p>
            <p>The ſecond argument (as a conſequent, and dependent upon the former) is thus: Thoſe that are quickned by Chriſt to a new life of grace, they cannot willingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully continue in ſinne: but thoſe that are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Chriſt, are quickned to a new life of grace, they cannot therefore willingly and wilfully continue in ſinne. The <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition the Apoſtle proves thus, thoſe that are dead with Chriſt are quickned to a new life of grace: Such as are juſtified by Chriſt are dead with Chriſt, therefore they are quickned to a new life with Chriſt, and therefore they cannot continue in ſinne. The <hi>Major</hi> propoſition is in the words of the Text, <hi>Now if wee be dead with Chriſt wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that we ſhall alſo live with him.</hi> You ſee the Logicke and argumentation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which words being a propoſition, and argument hupotheticall, obſerve in them two parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, an Antecedent, according to the law of ſuch propoſitions.</p>
            <p>And then, a Conſequent; Or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, one thing ſuppoſed, and another thing inferred.</p>
            <p>Firſt the thing ſuppoſed in the former part of the verſe, that <hi>we are dead with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:108344:15"/>
            <p>The other inferred in the latter part, <hi>wee beleeve that we ſhall alſo live with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly, you may pleaſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe foure parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt the method and order of the parts: firſt we muſt be dead with Chriſt before we can live with him, <hi>If wee be dead with Chriſt wee beleeve that wee ſhall alſo live with him.</hi> Wee muſt firſt die with Chriſt before wee can live with him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the inſeparable connexion and conjunction and union of theſe two: though the one goe before, yet the other followes inſeparably, and unavoydably, as <hi>Iacob</hi> tooke <hi>Eſau</hi> by the heele: In the latter part. <hi>Now if we be dead with Chriſt, we beleeve that we ſhall alſo live with him,</hi> there is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of theſe two.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the aſſurance of this connexion or conjunction, <hi>if we be dead with Chriſt, wee beleeve we ſhall live with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, the cauſe and ground, as of the two former, ſo of the latter, both of our death with Chriſt, and of our life with Chriſt, it is Chriſt, Chriſt is the cauſe of both, <hi>If we be dead with Chriſt,</hi> that is, (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> rightly interprets the place) through or by the vertue of Chriſt, <hi>Wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that wee ſhall alſo live with him,</hi> or bee raiſed to the life of grace by the ſame vertue. Thus you have the parts: <hi>If wee be dead with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108344:15"/> Chriſt, wee beleeve that we ſhall alſo live with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt of the order and method of the parts, which is the firſt part or propoſition.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Wee muſt firſt die with Chriſt before we can live with him.</head>
               <p>To be dead with Chriſt,<note place="margin">To be dead with Chriſt what.</note> is in imitation or conformitie with Chriſt to be dead to ſinne, as Chriſt dyed for ſinne. So we are ſayd to dye with Chriſt, when we dye to ſinne. Now we are ſayd to be dead to ſinne when ſinne is dead in us: when the command and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſinne is broken downe, when the power and force of it is enfeebled: when we doe what we can that ſinne may not have any vigour, or power, or command, no nor quiet being in us, then ſinne is ſayd to be properly dead in us.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt not conceive that as long as we live, ſinne will utterly and totally dye. The reaſon is this,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Baſil.</hi>
                  </note> (it is a compariſon of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſaith hee) it is with ſinne, and with the corruption of nature as it is with the Ivie,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and the wall, when the Ivie is faſtned and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into the wall, a man may cut the boughes and branches, but hee can never roote it out except hee pull downe the wall. As Ivie is to the wall, ſo is ſin and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our nature, it is ſo ſcrued and got into
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108344:16"/> our nature, that ſo long as we live, ſo long as this houſe of clay ſtands wee cannot utterly roote it out; wee may mortifie and kill it in ſome meaſure, but when this houſe of clay ſhall be demoliſhed and diſſolved, then ſinne ſhall be utterly extinguiſhed; I ſay then, we muſt not conceive ſinne to be ſo dead, as that it hath utterly no life in it, but it is ſayd to be dead in a double reſpect:
<list>
                     <item>Firſt it is dead Civilly.</item>
                     <item>Secondly it is dead Naturally.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>It is a rule among Civillians, <hi>he that is a ſervant is halfe a dead man.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe hee is no longer at his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but what he is, he is that he is, as hee is inſpired, and animated by the command of his maſter. So ſinne is ſaid to bee dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is made a ſervant, it is forced to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the yoake, to be ſubject to the Spirit of grace: therefore it is ſayd to bee dead ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is ſayd to bee dead naturally too; the reaſon is this, becauſe howſoever there bee ſome life left in it, yet it hath its deaths wound, &amp; that wil cauſe it to die at the laſt: In the meane while it is in the wane, and languiſheth away; ſo that as a man that hath received a mortall wound, he is a dead man, the reaſon is, becauſe that wound will bring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108344:16"/> death at the laſt: So we may ſay though ſinne have ſome life in it, yet it is dead naturally too; the reaſon is this, becauſe by the death of Chriſt, it hath received its deaths blow, that it will never recover, and ſo at the laſt it will altogether die.</p>
               <p>As ſinne is thus ſayd to bee dead in us, ſo we are ſayd to be dead to ſinne in a three ſold reſpect.</p>
               <p>You know death is nothing but the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſoule from the body, the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that that is the principle of life. Now looke what the ſoule is to the body, the ſame is ſinne, in a ſort, in a naturall unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, hee lives not ſo much by his ſoule as by his ſinne; his ſinne is the life of his life, it is that that enacts, and enlivens, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates him: therefore it is called <hi>the body of ſinne,</hi> why? becauſe ſinne is in an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate mans body as the ſoule is in the body, it gives life to it. A naturall man eſteemes ſinne as his ſoule and life; ſo the members of his body are called the members of ſinne; the reaſon is, becauſe looke as in nature the members exerciſe their functions by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and vertue of the ſoule; ſo an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man in the corrupt eſtate of depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nature, ſuch a man, his members worke as they are inabled and commanded by ſinne that dwells in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are ſayd to be dead to ſinne,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108344:17"/> in reſpect of thoſe antecedent convulſions and pangs that goe before death. Ordinarily there is no death without pangs and convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Now as it is in naturall death, ſo it is in this, there is no part of crucifying and mortifying of ſinne, without paine and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, therefore it is juſtly called death, the mortifying of ſinne; wee are ſaid to be dead to ſinne, when we mortifie ſinne, becauſe it is with ſo much paine, with convulſions and anguiſh: So ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi> The parting of a naturall man, the foregoing of his ſin, it is not without much torment and anguiſh: ſo in that reſpect it is ſaid to be a death, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thoſe convulſions and pangs that uſually are the forerunners and harbingers of death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee are dead to ſinne in another reſpect, for as a dead ſervant is no longer at the command of his Maſter, let him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what hee will hee heares him not, hee doth nothing. So it is with a man that is dead to ſin, let ſin command what it will, he heares not, hee liſtens not to the ſuggeſtions, he practiſeth not the commands of ſinne, he is as a dead man to ſinne. As a dead man performes not the offices of the living, a dead ſervant doth not obey the commands of his maſter, ſo it is with a man that is dead to ſinne. Let this be ſufficient to be ſpoken for the meaning of that phraſe, <hi>If we be dead
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108344:17"/> to ſinne,</hi> that is, as Chriſt dyed for ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If wee be dead with Chriſt, we beleeve that we ſhall alſo live with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a twofold life
<list>
                     <item>Naturall</item>
                     <item>Spirituall.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The naturall life is not here meant, but the ſpirituall life, that is, principally the life of grace and conſequently the life of glory. The reaſon is this, becauſe the life of grace, &amp; glory be not two lives, but one and the ſelfe ſame life, they differ onely in degrees. Looke as the life of the child in the wombe, is the ſame life that the child enjoyes, when it comes to bee borne and brought to light in the world; ſo the life of a Chriſtian in this world it is in a manner the ſame that he lives in heaven, onely I ſay it differs in degrees; For looke, as grace is nothing but glory begun, ſo glory is nothing but grace conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
               <p>But if he meane the life of grace,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> why doth the Apoſtle ſay <hi>ſhall live? If we be borne with Chriſt we ſhall live with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer briefly for two reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> to denote the time when wee ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> enjoy this life perfectly, that ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. When this naturall life ſhall have an end, then wee ſhall enjoy that ſpirituall life
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108344:18"/> perfectly; therefore the Apoſtle reflects on that life reſpectively to that time, and ſaith <hi>wee ſhall live</hi> the life of grace, becauſe then wee ſhall enjoy this life perfectly, whereas here we have it but in ſome meaſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with interruption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is ſayd in the future, <hi>we ſhall live,</hi> to affirme the perpetuity of this life; this life is not like the life of nature, a fading and periſhing life of its owne nature. It is the obſervation of <hi>Tolet</hi> the Ieſuite upon the place, ſaith hee, though the Apoſtle meane the life of grace, as we ſee by the 11. Verſe, yet hee uſeth the future tenſe, to ſhew that this life is a perpetuall life, and ſuch a life as hath no date nor period. I ſay it is in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tenſe, to ſignifie that the life of grace once begunne, it never hath date.</p>
               <p>Well, the words being cleared, I come to ſpeake of the firſt thing propoſed; the order and method of the Apoſtle in theſe words; <hi>If we be dead with Chriſt, wee beleeve that wee ſhall alſo live with him.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Wee muſt firſt die with Chriſt if wee <label type="milestone">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">We muſt firſt die with Chriſt if we will live with him.</note>For looke as it was with Chriſt, ſo it ſhall bee with every member of Chriſt; Chriſt firſt dyed before hee was raiſed to life; hee

As it was with Chriſt, ſo it muſt bee with every member of Chriſt, hee muſt firſt die before he can live, he muſt firſt have his <hi>Good Friday</hi> before hee have his <hi>Eaſter day,</hi> hee muſt firſt die to ſinne, before he can live to God.</p>
               <p>It is otherwiſe in the life of nature then it is in the life of grace, there a man muſt live before he die, but here hee muſt die before he can live. So ſaith S. <hi>Paul Epheſ.</hi> 4.22.24.<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.22.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Put off concerning your converſation, the old man which is corrupt according to the deceive able luſts,</hi> look in Ver. 24. then ſaith he <hi>put on the new man, which after God is created in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and righteouſneſſe.</hi> Then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here compares the life of grace to a new garment: before wee can put on the white and pure Stole of Chriſts righteouſnsſſe, we muſt firſt put off the filthy ragges of our owne corruption, <hi>put off concerning your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, the old man which is corrupt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the deceivable luſts.</hi> So in <hi>Epheſ</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.8.</note> 8. The life of grace is compared o light, the life of ſinne is compared to darkeneſſe, you know before the <hi>Medium</hi> be enlightned, the darkneſſe muſt be diſpelled: Firſt the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt be diſpelled before it can be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So this new life, it is ſayd to be a new Image; it is a new Image indeede, but it is ſuch an Image as we are not capable of, till
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108344:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> firſt wee be made pure Tables; the former Image of Sathan and the Characters of ſinne be defaced, till then wee are not capable of the Image of God, and the faire impreſſions of Grace. It is called an ingrafting, or inoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating: now wee cannot bee grafted into Chriſt, till we be cut off from the old ſtocke; I ſay generally, as wee muſt die to nature, before we can live to glory, ſo wee muſt die to ſinne, before wee can live to God.</p>
               <p>Looke what the Angell commanded <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua Ioſh.</hi> 5.8. to put off his ſhooes before he came to converſe with God. If you pleaſe to take the alluſion of <hi>Philo</hi> which is this, (and it is pertinent to our purpoſe) put off thy ſhooes before thou come to God, that is, put off dead workes, becauſe ſhooes are made of the skins of dead beaſts. I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee can live with Chriſt, wee muſt die with Chriſt, we muſt die to ſinne before wee can live the life of grace. The reaſon is plaine.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108344:19"/> in the ſame ſubject. It is an ordinary ſaying, The Bed and and the Throne admit not of partners.

Now ſinne and grace command contrary things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man can ſerve them both, eyther he will cleave to the one and deny the other, or forſake the one and cleave to the other. No man can ſerve ſinne and Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are contrary maſters. No man can ſerve two maſters when they command contrary things, that is the firſt reaſon: Wee muſt firſt die to ſinne, before wee can live the life of grace, becauſe they are oppoſites that will not admit of one another in the ſame ſubject.</p>
               <p>Secondly, till we be dead to ſinne we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <label type="milestone">

Whereſoever any ſinne reignes, in whom ſoever any luſt dominiers, what luſt ſoever it be, that man is a dead man, there is no true life of grace in him. The reaſon the Apoſtle gives in theſe words; becauſe wee muſt bee firſt dead to ſinne, before wee can live the life of grace; firſt our luſts muſt bee mortified and crucified in us, before wee can live with Chriſt the life of grace, wee muſt firſt paſſe this red Sea, that is, to die with Chriſt before we can enter into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to this life with Chriſt. But that I may make it more uſefull to you, let me ſhew you theſe foure things.</p>
               <p>Firſt let mee diſcover to you ſome falſe deaths, for as there is a falſe and counterfeit life of grace, ſo there are falſe and counterfeit deaths to ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let mee ſhew you ſome cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108344:21"/> whereby a man may know a true death to ſinne, whereby hee may judge and examine himſelfe, and know whether hee be dead to ſinne or no.</p>
               <p>In the third place I will ſhew you the meanes whereby (if a man bee not dead) a man may get this death, whereby hee may come to mortifie and crucifie the luſts and affections of the fleſh; and if hee bee dead, whereby hee may proceede on in the worke of mortification, becauſe mortification is not one individuall act, but hath a latitude, and admits of degrees.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I will ſhew you arguments to perſwade you to this death to ſinne with Chriſt, eſpecially ſuch as are immergent, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the words of the Text; Of all which briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt then of falſe deaths, that ſeeme to be true in ſhew, but are counterfeit deaths.</p>
               <p>There is a threefold death to ſinne.</p>
               <p>A
<list>
                     <item>Morall</item>
                     <item>Popiſh</item>
                     <item>Chriſtian</item>
                  </list> death to ſinne.</p>
               <p>The morall death to ſinne is diſtinguiſhed from the true death to ſinne, eſpecially in foure things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the maine difference is in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it; the truth is, a morall death is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede no death, hee that is morally dead to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108344:21"/> ſinne, is not indeede dead to ſinne: for ſuch a mortification takes away, not the life of ſinne, but the harſhneſſe, and rudeneſſe of ſinne, it takes it and reſtraines it, it makes ſin more tractable and ſmooth, and ſubtill, but it takes not away the life of ſinne; that is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it differs in the efficient cauſe, the efficient cauſe of a Chriſtians mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> 
                  <hi>If yee mortifie the deeds of the fleſh through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> but the cauſe efficient of morall mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it is from the temper of the body, or good education, or the like. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it proceede from the Spirit, from the generall, common operation of the Spirit, or from the ſpeciall ſaving and ſanctifying ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gods Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thridly, morall mortification differs from that which is true, in reſpect of the Latitude: he that is morally mortified, he is mortified onely in reſpect of outward groſſe ſinnes, in reſpect of ſuch things as are more notorious, ſuch as run in the eyes of men, ſuch as cauſe diſgrace, and diſhonour, and obloquie: but ſecret ſpirituall ſinnes are unmortified, nay, (it is the obſervation of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that) a morall man, though he ſeeme to the eye to be never ſo much mortified (as indeede if a man looke on their formal auſterity, to looke on <hi>Cato</hi> or ſuch a one, a man would judge
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108344:22"/> them mortified) yet commonly they feede one luſt, and for the ſake of that they curbe the reſt. So Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon the <hi>Romans</hi> obſerves, the luſt of covetouſneſſe, of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, of intemperance, &amp;c. they curbe them being over borne with the luſt of ambition; ſaith he, they keepe down all other luſts that they may give more ſcope to this one luſt, in his fift booke <hi>de Civit. dei Chap.</hi> 12. But a true Chriſtians mortification is univerſall, hee doth not kill ſome ſinnes, as <hi>Saul</hi> killed the ſmall Cattell, and left <hi>Agag,</hi> and the great ones, but he mortifies and crucifies all ſinne, true mortification will not ſuffer a man to allow himſelfe in the practice of any one ſinne.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, morall mortification differs from Chriſtian in reſpect of the iſſue; hee that is truly mortified, in ſuch a one ſinne hath received its deaths wound in him, it never comes fully to be healed and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it ſelfe againe. Indeede if hee be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the exerciſe of mortification it may get ſtrength upon us; as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> grew ſtronger, but they never obtayned that abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and dominion in <hi>Canaan</hi> as before: but for a morrall man, becauſe ſin is not truly mortified in him, therefore when thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints and retentives are taken away that kept in ſinne, it rages and dominiers as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108344:22"/> much as it did before in him, or as it doth in another man. Let this ſuffice to be ſpoken of the difference of morall mortification from that of a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Popiſh mortification differs from true mortification, in all the degrees and cauſes.</p>
               <p>It differs from Chriſtian mortification.</p>
               <p>In the
<list>
                     <item>efficient</item>
                     <item>materiall</item>
                     <item>formall</item>
                     <item>finall</item>
                  </list> cauſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt Popiſh mortification differs from Chriſtian in reſpect of the object matter; the principall object in Popiſh mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not ſo much perhaps ſinne in the members, but the members themſelves, they laſh and teare them with ſcourges and whips, their ayme is not ſo much againſt ſinne as the members; whereas true mortification is a revenge on the members as they are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſinne: a mans principall grudge is againſt ſinne in his members, and not againſt the members that ſinne dwells in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they differ in the efficient cauſe the cauſe efficient of true mortification is the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> 
                  <hi>If yee through the Spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the body;</hi> but the cauſe efficient in Popiſh mortification is, among too many themſelves; they offer,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108344:23"/> violence to themſelves, ſelfe conſiderations is the ſumme of their mortification.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the formall cauſe of Popiſh mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is humbling the body, abſtinence and rending the humane body by whippes, and ſcourges: this they make the true bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the dying of Chriſt in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:<note place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, they differ in reſpect of the end, and ayme of both; Popiſh mortification ends not in the deſtruction of ſinne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebling the power of it ſo much as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of God for ſinne: Heare what <hi>Getzer</hi> ſaith in the ſame place, in his ſecond booke of diſcipline, Chap. 8. ſaith he, <hi>ſuch as whip themſelves till the blood come, for their ſinnes, by ſuch whipping of themſelves they ſatisfie Gods juſtice for their ſinnes.</hi> What Chriſtian heart can heare ſuch Doctrine and his heart not ake, &amp; his ears not glow, and his joynts tremble? Bleſſed Saviour that they that ſtile themſelves by thy name ſhould derogate from thee by their blaſphemies! Wee ſay the blood of Chriſt expiates ſinne, they ſay
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108344:23"/> their owne blood wilfully ſhed, ſatisfies God for their ſinnes: whereas the end of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an an mortification is not to ſatisfie God for ſinne, but to infeeble the power of ſinne, to breake downe the command and dominion of ſinne. This ſhall ſuffice to bee ſpoken concerning the firſt point propoſed, the falſe deaths to ſinne, and thoſe are two; Morall, and Popiſh.</p>
               <p>Now I come to ſhew the Characters of a man that is truly dead to ſinne with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſigne of a man that is dead to ſinne is this, that when occaſions are offered, and invite him to ſinne hee doth not yeeld, this is an argument that that man is dead to ſinne. It is true I confeſſe there is great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in occaſions, that except wee keepe a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous guard they are able to tranſport a holy ſanctifyed man, and ſo they have done the beſt; but I ſay ſuch a man, as when no ſooner an occaſion is preſented, but hee is ready to give way to ſatisfie his luſt, ſuch a man, let him pretend what he will, hee is not dead to ſinne. He is like a tree, wee know in winter there is no viſible &amp; apparent difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a dead tree, and that that is alive,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them have eyther fruite or leaves, they differ not in outward view: but when the ſpring comes againe and the Sunne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth, then there is a difference, then the juice in the roote ſhootes up, and diffuſeth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108344:24"/> it ſelfe into the reſt of the parts: you may know a tree whether it be dead or alive, when the Spring comes, when the Sun approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, if it doth not ſhoote forth and flouriſh then, we ſay it is a dead tree. I apply it thus looke what the Sunne is to the tree, ſo is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to luſts: he that doth not ſin when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are offered and preſent themſelves: when a man hath occaſion to ſatisfie his luſts if he doe it not, this man is truly dead to ſin. Whereas ſuch a man as eyther through age or want of opportunity and occaſion is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from fulfilling his luſts, but in the meane while he pleaſeth himſelfe to revolve them in his mind, and to diſcourſe of them with his tongue, ſuch a man is not dead to ſinne; if he had the ſame ſtrength and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſented as before, ſuch a man would diſcover that ſinne were alive in him as much as ever it was.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee may know we are dead to ſinne if all ſinne be dead in us: it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that one luſt ſeeme to be mortified, and crucified in us unleſſe all be mortified. Wee know there is life in an Apple tree, or a Peare tree if it produce but one Apple, or Peare: So we may know that ſinne is alive in us, if there be but one reigning domineiring ſinne. It is true I confeſſe in the beſt men, ſinne is ſo much alive in them, that ever and anon it will be ſhooting forth ſome of theſe curſed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108344:24"/> fruits; but yet (as wee ſhall ſee in the third place) the power of it is more infeebled; I ſay where one ſinne or luſt rules and dominiers in a man, that man is not dead to ſinne, as if an Apple tree bring forth but one apple wee conclude it is not dead.</p>
               <p>Thirdly a dead man cannot performe the workes of a living man, when wee performe not the workes and ſervice of ſinne, then we are dead to ſinne. Every thing hath power to bring forth fruite according to its owne nature, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.39.<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.39.</note> 
                  <hi>If you were the children of Abraham, you would bring forth the fruits of Abraham.</hi> Now if a man bring forth ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the fruits of ſinne, let him ſay what hee will, ſinne is alive in that man. I grant that as I ſayd before, ſinne will ever and anon bee ſending forth bitter and curſed fruits, but he that is ordinarily and commonly tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſervice of his owne luſts that man is not dead to ſinne. Shall a man ſay hee is a dead man that lives in pride? that hee is a dead man that lives in ſwearing or unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp;c? I ſay he that is ordinarily, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually tranſported with pride, with ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and blaſphemy, with uncleanneſſe, &amp;c. he that is ordinarily tranſported to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of any ſinne, that man is not dead to ſinne.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is not ſufficient to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the practice of ſinne, but to abhorre and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108344:25"/> deteſt ſin: we know when we come by apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified dead Corſe, we ſtop our noſes, to ſhew that we abhor the noyſome ſmell and deteſt it. If we doe not onely forbeare ſin but loath and abhorre it, it is a ſigne that ſinne is dead, it is a Carkaſſe, we begin to abhorre it.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, by this Character wee ſhall know that ſinne is dead, if daily more and more wee ſee the power of ſinne abated and infee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in us; we know dying men, the nearer they draw to the grave the more weake are all the actions and functions of the ſoule: So I ſay, ſinne ſhall never in this life be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, but it hath its deadly blow, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth away. Now then we may know we are dead to ſinne, if ſinne more and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and the power of it bee more and more feeble, if every day the inclinations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to ſinne are more weake.</p>
               <p>Yet miſtake not, a man may deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by this Character: for oft times it comes to paſſe that ſinne when it hath its mortall, and deaths wound, it rageth more then it did before.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> It fares with ſinne as with a wild beaſt that hath received his deaths wound, he rageth more then he did before: So ſinne and Sathan, then labour to provoke and ſtirre up corruption in a man to rage more, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſtay a while, and you ſhall ſee the power of it more infeebled: So I ſay a man muſt not judge himſelfe by the preſent fit or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108344:25"/> rage of ſinne to have no ſparke of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that may bee occaſioned by the deaths blow of ſinne; but looke if ſinne bee enfeebled, and the inclinations and luſts to ſinne grow every day weaker then other, and that is an argument that ſinne is dead.</p>
               <p>Sixtly we may know that wee are dead to ſinne by this argument, then a man is dead to ſinne, when he can willingly and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indure the Axe of the Goſpel to be laid to the roote of his ſinne, when he can patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit himſelfe to have his ſinne woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and to have it executed by the <hi>ſword of the Spirit.</hi> I ſay patiently to indure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of his ſinne, eſpecially when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe is layd againſt the ſinne that moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes againſt him, the ſinne that a man loves deareſt, patiently to indure the reproofe of that ſinne is an argument that that man is mortified, and dead to ſinne. Let a man ſay what he will, hee that ſtormes and grudges, and grumbles and chafes when his ſinne is met with in the Miniſtery of the word that man is unmortified, at the leaſt ſo farre as he chafes and frets, ſo farre hee is unmortified. Hee that is mortified to ſinne, hee that is growne to a loathing and deteſtation of his ſinne, he rejoyceth when the Miniſtery meets with his ſinne, Oh ſaith ſuch a one that my ſinne might bee met with to day! I ſtand in termes of hoſtilitie with it, I would have it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108344:26"/> put to death, Oh! that it might have one blow to day by the Sword of the Spirit: ſuch a man as will not indure the reproofe of his ſinne hee is unmortified, at leaſt ſo farre as he is impatient of reproofe.</p>
               <p>Yet miſtake not, a man may bee more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient for ſome ſinnes than for others: for though in a gracious man all ſinne bee morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yet ſome ſinnes be more rooted, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated. As wee ſay in Philoſophie, there are ſome parts that live firſt, and die laſt, as the heart. As it is in the body 'ſo it is in the ſtate of nature, in the body, of ſinne: there are ſome ſinnes in which life is more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated; and one ſinne may have more life when others are mortified, one may have more ſtrength then others, and life in it, and yet the mortification be true; yet generally ſuch men as are impatient at the reproofe of their luſts, eſpecially that luſt that dominiers, that man is unmortified; he that is a mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, that ſinne is dead in, he will ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe patiently.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the third thing I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſhew the meanes whereby wee may come to be dead with Chriſt: for if wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to live with Chriſt, but wee muſt firſt die with Chriſt, then it mainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes us to labour to die with Chriſt to ſin, that ſo wee may come at the laſt to live with him. The meanes are foure.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:108344:26"/>
               <p>The firſt cauſe which is the principall cauſe is the Spirit of God, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. the place before alleadged, <hi>If yee mortifie the deeds of the fleſh through the Spirit yee ſhall live.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> It is true, we are enjoyned mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, but wee cannot doe it till by the Spirit of God our ſinnes be mortified.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> It is with ſinne as it is with ſome wilde beaſts, they cannot bee taken and apprehended till they be ſhot and wounded: So it is with ſinne, till the Spirit of God give the deaths blow to ſinne wee cannot mortifie it of our ſelves; therefore the firſt and principall cauſe is the Spirit of God, <hi>he that is in us is ſtronger then he that is in the world.</hi> The Spirit of God is ſtrong and powerfull to ſubdue ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Faith in Chriſt: for by faith we muſt be ingrafted into Chriſt, and ſo partake of the Spirit of Chriſt whereby ſinne is dead in us, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom..</hi> 6 5.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.5.</note> 
                  <hi>For if we be planted into the likeneſſe of his death wee ſhall be alſo into the likeneſſe of his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Firſt we muſt be planted and grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt: As a Syens muſt be planted into the ſtocke of a tree before it partake of the juice of it: So we muſt be planted into Chriſt by faith before we be made partakers of the vertue of the death of Chriſt to kill our ſins;<note place="margin">Col. 2.13.</note> ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Wee are rayſed through the faith of the operation of God,</hi> it is through faith, not onely as a perſwading, mooving
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108344:27"/> cauſe, but as an efficient cauſe, becauſe faith as a pipe of Silver conveyes the juice, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, the Spirit of God, whereby our ſinnes are mortified, it unites us to Chriſt and makes us partake of the vertue of his death whereby our ſinnes are killed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 19.13.</note>The third meanes to worke this death in us it is Prayer, ſo <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Lord keepe mee from preſumptuous ſinnes, let them not have dominion over me,</hi> that is, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and crucifie them ſo that they may not have dominion over me, or not have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if it were poſſible, <hi>Let them not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, a ſpeciall meanes to put ſinne to death is to ſubmit our ſelves to the Miniſtery of the Word, ſuch as can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and brandiſh the two edged Sword of the Spirit againſt ſinne. And ſo in private by meditation to apply to our ſelves the curſes and judgements that God hath threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch ſinnes as wee give moſt way to: for if once the principall and vitall ſinne (as I may call it) be deſtroyed, then other ſinnes will die of themſelves; this ſhall be ſufficient for the third part, touching the meanes to die with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I come now in a few words to the motives to perſwade us to die with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt ariſeth from the neceſſitie of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108344:27"/> to ſinne, eyther wee muſt die to ſinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> or die for ſinne, woe to us if we doe not die to ſin, <hi>If yee live after the fleſh yee ſhall die, Rom.</hi> 8.13. that is, if yee live unmortified yee ſhall die, how? eternally, not onely the death of the body but of the ſoule too, here is the choyce, we muſt eyther mortifie our luſts or incurre the danger of damnation, there is no other way to eſcape it, <hi>If yee live after the fleſh yee ſhall die,</hi> that is, eternally, therefore there lies a neceſſitie that ſhould perſwade us to die to ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the commoditie of it, by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſinne we ſhall not onely free our ſelves from eternall death, but from much trouble and moleſtation, and diſquiet alſo that wee ſhould be ſure to have by keeping ſinne alive, and by yeelding to the luſts of ſinne. Moſt true it is that it is with our luſts as with little children, humour and obſerve them,<note place="margin">Simile</note> and give them that they cry for, and you ſhall never have reſt, but ſtill they will cry for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, ſo it is with our corruptions and ſinfull luſts yeeld to them upon every deſire, and we ſhall never have done, when we have ſatisfied one luſt, it will call upon us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and will never have done; whereas by mortifying of it, we ſhall bring to our ſelves much quiet, and free our ſelves from much moleſtation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider the facilitle, by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108344:28"/> the deeds of the fleſh we looſe nothing that will make to our happineſſe; <hi>Adam</hi> in innocencie in Paradiſe was happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe luſts, Chriſt on earth was happy without them: the Saints in heaven are happy without them,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.21.</note> theſe are but ſuperfluities, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Lay aſide all ſuperfluitie of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe and malice.</hi> Wee may have all true contentment whatſoever, &amp; yet part withour luſts; they are things that we may well ſpare: By mortification of them, a man looſeth no profit, nor pleaſure, nor honour whatſoever, but there is recompence with advantage. Let a man mortifie his luſts that bring him profit, hee ſhall have profit in durable riches, not onely in this life, but for his reward hee ſhall have a whole kingdome to enjoy. Let him looſe ſome preſent pleaſures (as we have all too much of common Souldiers in us, we love preſent pay) hee ſhall have infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, he ſhall have pure pleaſures, peace of conſcience, God will praiſe him, and ſay, <hi>well done good and faithfull ſervant,</hi> he ſhall have peace of conſcience, that will lift a man above ground, an infinite recompence in the loſſe of other pleaſures. Secondly for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, what if a man for the crucifying of his luſts be reproached and contemned in the world, yet he ſhall have true honour of God in heaven, he ſhall have honour of Angels, of good men; honour did I ſay of good men, nay
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108344:28"/> wicked men ſhall honour him. God is able to command honour from the hearts even of wicked men, ſo much as hee is mortified: Let a wicked man ſee one that is a mortified man, (that as <hi>David</hi> was he behaves himſelfe as a weaned child from the world) he cannot but give a good teſtimony, but if he will not now, let him be on the racke in ſickneſſe, let death appeare, then he will deſire <hi>to die the death of the righteous; and that his laſt end may be like his.</hi> It is true while he is in his jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and bravery, then ſuch men load a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified man with reproach and contempt: but wee muſt doe as Phiſitians doe, when they judge by urine of the ſtate of the body, they looke not on the urine that is voyded when men are walking up and downe before they goe to bed,<note place="margin">Simile</note> but that which they make after their firſt ſleepe when they are come to themſelves. So take not a wicked man now in the fulfilling of his luſts, but looke on that man when hee hath ſlept, and you will judge otherwiſe of him, he cannot chuſe but give a good teſtimony of a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, conſider the Equitie of it, Chriſt died for ſinne that wee might die to ſinne, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.24.</note> 
                  <hi>who his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his owne body on the tree, that we being dead to ſinne ſhould live unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> What, did Chriſt lay downe his life for our luſts,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108344:29"/> and ſhall not wee lay downe our luſts for Chriſt, did Chriſt die for our ſinnes, and ſhall not we for Chriſt die to our ſinnes?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, conſider our ſins are Traytors, and rebels againſt heaven.<note place="margin">Tertul. Apol. cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> Well ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologie for the Chriſtians in his ſecond Chapter; againſt Traytors and ſuch as are common enemies every man muſt be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier. Now our ſinnes are Traytors againſt heaven, we cannot better expreſſe our loyaltie and alleagance to our great Maſter, God, then to kill and put to death theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, it is a moſt acceptable ſacrifice to God.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly conſider the example of other men, we ſee what care men take, and what paine they will undergoe, not for the avoyding but for the putting off a naturall, a temporall death for a while. Men for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of this temporall life, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not onely to take harſh Phyſick, but to indure launcing, and ſearing and cutting off the parts, a leg or an arme, &amp;c. ſo to preſerve naturall life; if they doe ſo for preſerving of this naturall life, Oh what ſhould wee doe for the gaining of eternall life? It is true Chriſt compares luſts to eyes, and hands, and feete, it is true they are eyes, but ſuch as when they are pulled out wee may ſee well enough. They are hands, but ſuch hands, as when they are cut off wee may ſtill doe what wee have to doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108344:29"/> them. Now ſhall a man for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of his temporall life, indure a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be cut off, &amp; ſhall not we cut off our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous luſts for the gaining of eternal life? ſhal they, not for the avoyding, but for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiting of death indure this pain,<note place="margin">S. Aug. Epiſt. <hi>45.</hi>
                  </note> and ſhal not we for the avoyding of eternall death? S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> preſſeth this excellent well in his Epiſt. 45. They doe this, not as if there were any hope to put off death quite, but only to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journe, and put it off for the preſent; if they do this for the reſpite of death, what ſhould we do for the avoiding of eternal death, ſaith he? They undergoe many certaine torments, perhaps that they may have hope, but of a few uncertaine dayes, what! do they thus for a temporal life, ſhal not we much more for the procuring of an eternal life? Do they ſo much for the adjourning of a temporall death, and ſhall not wee for the avoyding a perpetuall, and eternall death? If theſe arguments per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us not, none can, ſo much for the fourth point, the Motives to this death to ſin.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if we muſt die with Chriſt, before we can live with him;<note place="margin">S. Ierome.</note> then as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſomewhere hath it; <hi>It is not ſo eaſie a thing as ſome happily conceive it, to bee a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> It was <hi>Iulians</hi> ſcoffe of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iulian.</note> and in him of all Chriſtians: To be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian there is no more required, but to waſh themſelves with a little water, that is, to bee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108344:30"/> baptiſed, and how great ſoever their ſinnes were before, this cleanſeth them, ſaith <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> or if it chance that a man fall into the ſame ſinnes againe; ſaith <hi>Iulian,</hi> It is no more for theſe Chriſtians but to beat their breaſts, and to ſmite their heads, and all is well againe: (in the concluſion of his <hi>Caeſars.</hi>) But the beſt is, it matters not greatly what <hi>Iulian</hi> ſaith; it concerned him to ſpeake evill of that ſaith he was fallen away from; if he had ſpoken well of it, hee had ſpoken againſt himſelfe. But he that knew better then <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.14.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtraite if the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life,</hi> Math. 7.14. The way to heaven is ſtraite, he that will enter in this way muſt ſtrippe and diveſt himſelfe of his old luſts: The way of Chriſtianitie is a narrow way; nay, that is not all, it is a way full of paine, and preſſures to the fleſh, as <hi>Camerarius</hi> interprets that place; <hi>Narrow is the way, and full of paine to the fleſh;</hi> He that walkes this way, muſt reſolve to meet with difficulties, hee muſt take out leſſons that are harſh to fleſh and bloud, to mortifie, nay, to crucifie the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and luſts.</hi> Every death is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to expreſſe the paine hee muſt undergoe, but crucifying only, the death that Chriſt died, that was both a lingring and painfull death. Thus every man that will live with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108344:30"/> Chriſt muſt firſt crucifie his ſinfull luſts and affections.</p>
               <p>Which notwithſtanding I ſpeake not, to deterre or diſcourage any from entring into the way of Chriſtianitie, or having entred, for going on in the ſame way: No, God-forbid, that I ſhould (like the ten ſpies that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent to ſpie out the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>) bring an ill report upon the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but to informe us, and arme us. Hee that is to travaile into a farre Countrey, on which his life and livelihood depends, and ſhould meet with a friend that ſhould tell him the way were deepe, and troubleſome, and that there were ſuch difficulties did ſtand in the way; hee would eaſily perceive that hee did tell him this, not to diſcourage and diſhearten him, becauſe hee is his friend, nor to ſtay his journey; becauſe hee knowes it is upon his life, his life lies on it; but to arme and prepare him before hand, that when he ſhould meet with the difficulties, hee might the better encounter them, and goe over them. I apply it thus, Heaven is our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, we all pretend wee are Pilgrims tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to heaven: the way that leads to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is this narrow way, our death with Chriſt: the neceſſitie of walking this way appeares in <hi>Math.</hi> 7.14. This way,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.114.</note> and only this leades to life, <hi>it is the ſtraite gate and the narrow way that leads to life?</hi> Now when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108344:31"/> wee tell you of Lyons, and Beares in the way, the difficulties, and incombrances that you ſhall meet with, it is not to diſcourage you, but to arme, and provide you. It is not to diſhearten you, you muſt needs goe, your life lies upon it; but to arme and prepare you, that when you meet with theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, you may be the better provided to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them. It is good ſaith the Proverbe, to know the worſt of things before hand, leſt otherwiſe after wee have walked in the way, we meet with incombrances, and drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of nothing but delicacies, our hearts faile us, as the hearts of the Iſraelites in the report of the tenne ſpies. Like the fooliſh builder in <hi>Luke</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Luke 4.</note> that was not able to goe on with his building, becauſe hee did not ſit downe firſt, and reckon what it would coſt him.</p>
               <p>Sixtly and laſtly, if wee muſt firſt die with Chriſt, before we can live with him, it ſerves for direction to teach us what order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode to take to come to live with Chriſt. He that will live with Chriſt, muſt be ſure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the right end, to die with Chriſt firſt: he that will performe holy duties, &amp; gracious actions, that man muſt labour to crucifie and mortifie ſinfull affections. Sinfull affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are like weedes; the Husbandman that deſires his corne ſhould thrive and live, hee labours firſt to kill the weedes. I ſay ſinfull
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108344:31"/> affections in the ſoule are like weedes in the ground, or ſoyle; if wee deſire that grace ſhould thrive, and to performe gracious duties with content to our ſelves and to God, we muſt labour to kill our luſts. When wee find in our ſelves an unaptneſſe, and an indiſpoſition to the performance of gracious duties, ſuppoſe it bee to prayer, to humble ourſelves before God, to heare the word of God, &amp;c. let us then reflect on our ſelves, and ſee what ſinfull luſts there have gotten ſtrength, and labour to abate the power of that, and then certainly wee ſhall live with Chriſt, wee ſhall bee enabled to performe holy duties; So ſaith the Apoſtle (in the ſecond place) <hi>If wee bee dead with Chriſt, wee beleeve that wee ſhall alſo live with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which is the ſecond thing I propoſed in the beginning. The connexion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of theſe two; <hi>If wee bee dead with Chriſt, wee ſhall alſo live with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where firſt give me leave to remember you of what I formerly delivered in the unfolding of theſe words: that the life that the Apoſtle here meanes, when he ſaith; <hi>If wee bee dead with Chriſt, wee ſhall alſo live with him;</hi> it is the ſame that in verſe 4. hee calls <hi>Newneſſe of life. Therefore wee are buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him by baptiſme into death, that as Chriſt was raiſed by the glory of the Father,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108344:32"/> ſo wee ſhould walke in newneſſe of life.</hi> I ſay the Apoſtle meanes here <hi>the life of Grace,</hi> which in verſe 4. hee calls <hi>newneſſe of life.</hi> And in verſe 11. hee calls it <hi>living to God: Likewiſe reckon yee your ſelves dead to ſinne, but alive to God.</hi> Though ſecondarily, and by conſequent, I deny not but that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle meanes living with God in life eternall. And the reaſon is, as I ſhewed before, that the difference of <hi>the life of grace,</hi> and <hi>the life of glory,</hi> it is not in Nature, but in degrees, <hi>Grace</hi> is <hi>Glory</hi> begun, and <hi>glory</hi> is nothing but <hi>grace</hi> perfected. As the childe in the wombe hath the ſame life that it enjoyes in the world, only then it is in a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: ſo the life that a Chriſtian enjoyes in this world, it is the ſame life in nature though it differ in degrees from that hee enjoyes in heaven.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle uſeth the future tenſe; <hi>If we bee dead with Chriſt, wee believe that wee ſhall live with him,</hi> for theſe three reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to ſhew the order and Methode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this life, and the former death: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this life in nature, though not in time is after our death with Chriſt. As it is in nature, the introducing of habites in nature, is after the expelling of privations, as the enlightning of the ayre in nature is after the diſpelling of darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle uſeth the future
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108344:32"/> tenſe, becauſe though the life of Grace bee here begunne, yet it is not conſumate till afterward, in which reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>Wee beleeve that wee ſhall live with him.</hi> Hee makes this life in reſpect of the complement, and conſummation an act of faith, according to that in the Creed; <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the life everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the <hi>life of grace</hi> doth not fade as the naturall life perriſheth, but it is an induring life. As Chriſt being once rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he died no more, verſe 9. ſo every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt, he that is once quickned, and raiſed with Chriſt from ſinne, hee dieth no more, ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.24. <hi>hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth hath eternall life.</hi> What? hath every one that beleeveth life eternall? Yes, every one that beleeveth hath life eternall in hope, and in the beginning of grace; becauſe hee hath that life for the preſent, that doth not fade and periſh, but endure to eternitie, <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſay unto you, hee that heareth my word, and beleeveth in him that ſent mee, hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and ſhall not come into condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which expreſſeth the former.</p>
               <p>Now what this life of grace is, this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, will appeare by comparing it with ſpirituall death. It is the propertie of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites being ſet together; as to impugne, and fight againſt the nature one of another, ſo to diſcover the nature one of another.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:108344:33"/>
               <p>Now ſpirituall death, as the Naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a ſeparation from the fountaine, and principle of life.</p>
               <p>And, as a conſequent of that, a privation of the faculties, and acts of life.</p>
               <p>Looke what the ſoule is to the body, the ſame is the Spirit of Chriſt to the Soule, it is that that enlivens and quickens it, ſo ſaith Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.63:</note> 
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickens.</hi> Now looke, as upon the parting of the ſoule from the body, the body dies; ſo upon the ſeparation of the Spirit of God from the ſoule, the ſoule dies. So it was in <hi>Adam,</hi> when by eating the forbidden fruit, hee had cut off, and ſeparated himſelfe from the fountaine, and principle of life, he died ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually. I ſay, as when the Soule that enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and quickens the body, when that is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the body dies, ſo the Spirit of Chriſt that enlivens and quickens the ſoule, when that is ſeparated from the ſoule, the ſoule dies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, looke as upon the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, there follows a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of the faculties, and acts of life: ſo upon the ſeparation of the Spirit of God from the Soule, there followes a deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the habits and acts of grace. The gifts and habits of grace, are as the faculties; the acts and operations of grace, are as the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108344:33"/> acts of thoſe faculties: and as upon the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, there followes a deprivation of the faculties, and acts of life, ſo upon the ſeparation of the Spirit of Chriſt from the Soule, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes a deprivation of the habites and acts of grace.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo, then ſpirituall life includes two things,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the having of the Spring and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of life, the Spirit of God, and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the having the habites, and acts of this ſpirituall life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the having of the principle of ſpirituall life, the having the Spirit of God in our ſoules: for it is not ſufficient that there be a quickening Spirit, unleſſe it bee united to us. For looke as when a man dies,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the ſoule of a man, and the body of a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill, but there is no life, becauſe the ſoule is not united to the body: ſo I ſay there may be a ſpirituall death, though there bee the Spirit of God, and the Soule; if the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be not united to the ſoule: that is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, where the Spirit of God is (as a conſequent of the other,) there followes the faculties, and acts of life: the habituall preſence of all the graces of the Spirit, band the actuall exerciſe of them. In theſe two
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108344:34"/> conſiſts the nature of this life. Theſe things premiſed, I come to ſhew the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of this ſpirituall life (that I have explained in the kind and nature of it) with ſpirituall death. <hi>If wee be dead with Chriſt, wee beleeve that wee ſhall alſo live with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Hupotheticall propoſition, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition affords us this Catagoricall Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that
<q>Thoſe that are dead with Chriſt, ſhall live with him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For when the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>If wee be dead with Chriſt, we beleeve that wee ſhall alſo live with him.</hi> This is ſuppoſed: as much as if he had ſaid in effect;
<q>They that are dead with Chriſt, ſhall live with him;</q> 
                  <hi>Or,</hi>
                  <q>They that are dead to ſinne, ſhall live the life of grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Looke as it was with Chriſt, ſo it is with the members of Chriſt; as hee being dead roſe againe, and could not chooſe but riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> (As it is ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>the chaines of death, the cords of death could not hold him;</hi>) So it is with every member of Chriſt, hee that is dead with Chriſt, muſt needes live with Chriſt, Death cannot hold him, not death
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108344:34"/> in ſinne. The Apoſtle affirmes as much in this Chapter verſe 5. <hi>For as wee are planted into the likeneſſe of his death, ſo wee ſhall be alſo into the likeneſſe of his reſurrection.</hi> If wee be planted with Chriſt into his death; (there is our death with Chriſt,) we ſhall be alſo in his Reſurrection: (there is the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and connexion of our life with Chriſt,) where the Apoſtle not only averres the truth of the former propoſition, but withall inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates the reaſon of it: thoſe that are planted with Chriſt into the ſimilitude of his death, ſhall alſo into the ſimilitude of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Why? becauſe they are planted with Chriſt. As a Plant that is grafted into a ſtocke, it partakes of the whole vertue of the ſtocke: ſo every member of Chriſt, hee that by faith is grafted into Chriſt, and made partaker of the vertue of Chriſts death, to the mortification of ſinne: that man alſo is made partaker of the vertue of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to the reviving, and quickening of him to a new life of grace.</p>
               <p>The ground of it is this; Firſt, to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt communicates himſelfe, hee communicates himſelfe wholly; to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee imparts the vertue of his death for the killing of ſinne, to him hee imparts the vertue of his Reſurrection to revive, and quicken him to a new life of grace; <hi>If wee be planted with Chriſt into the ſimilitude of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108344:35"/> his death, wee ſhall be alſo into the ſimilitude of his Reſurrection;</hi> becauſe wee are planted with him. Every plant partakes of the whole vertue of the roote, and by conſequent wee partake as well of the quickening vertue of Chriſt to raiſe us to the life of grace, as of his crucifying vertue to kill ſinne.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is from the inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the one without the other; <hi>If wee be dead with Chriſt, we beleeve that wee ſhall alſo live with him;</hi> Why? becauſe death with Chriſt is inſufficient, unleſſe wee live with Chriſt. Philoſophie ſaith that nature doth nothing in vaine: much leſſe doth Chriſt, the God of Nature. Now as in Chriſt, it was in vaine for him to die for us, unleſſe hee had riſen againe: ſo it is in vaine, and ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for the members of Chriſt to die to ſin, if they be not quickened to the life of grace.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is this, that death to ſinne indeed, defaceth the Image of ſinne, but it doth not renew in us the Image of God Now it is the Image of God that makes us fit and capable of eternall life: It is true, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt gives us title to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life; but our owne inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe qualifies us, and diſpoſeth, and makes us fit, and capable of it, for <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God. Fleſh and bloud ſhall not enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> By mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of ſinne, wee ceaſe to be ſinners; by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108344:35"/> mortifying of ſinne wee have the Image of Satan defaced; but the Image of God is not renewed in us; therefore beſides our death with Chriſt, there is required our life with Chriſt, that ſo beſides the defacing of Satans Image, wee may have the Image of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, that wee may be capable of eternall life, and be qualified and diſpoſed, and made fit to partake <hi>of the inheritance with the Saints in light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Argument is drawne from the oppoſition betweene the life of ſinne, and the life of grace; Philoſophy tells us that in thoſe oppoſites, that are immediatly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite; that is, ſuch oppoſites where one muſt of neceſſitie be in the ſubject, if one be removed, the other of neceſſitie followes the ſubject; Health and ſickneſſe are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate objects, a man muſt either bee ſicke or well: Now that which removes ſickneſſe, reſtores health, that that expells darkneſſe out of the Ayre, it brings light. Now the life of ſinne and grace are thus oppoſite, that that takes away the life of ſinne then, it muſt of neceſſitie bring with it <hi>the life of grace.</hi> If Chriſt mortifie ſinne in us, and take away the life and vigour of ſinne, Chriſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie muſt bring into the ſame ſubject <hi>the life of grace;</hi> becauſe theſe are immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, hee that takes away the one, muſt bring in the other, as that that takes away ſickneſſe,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108344:36"/> brings in health. This ſhall ſuffice for the proofe of the point. I come to make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label>
                  <hi>If wee be dead with Chriſt, wee ſhall alſo live with him.</hi> Thoſe that are dead with Chriſt to ſinne, as Chriſt died for ſinne, thoſe ſhall live the life of grace. If it bee ſo, if there be ſuch a neceſſary connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two, then it followes backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that thoſe that doe not live with Chriſt, thoſe are not dead with Chriſt. For looke as it is betweene Faith, and good Workes, if good workes be neceſſarily joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Faith, then where there are no good workes, there is no faith: So thus it followes, if ſpirituall life, <hi>the life of grace,</hi> bee neceſſarily joyned with death to ſinne, then where there is no life of grace, there is no death to ſinne. According to that of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi>
                  </note> ſaith hee, it is true indeed, faith without workes is dead; ſo it is true on the other ſide, workes without faith is dead. No man can performe good workes, though hee may for ſubſtance, yet not <hi>formaliter</hi> without Faith; hee that hath not Faith, hath not Workes. If good Workes be neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyned with Faith, then where there are no good Workes, there is no Faith: ſo if our life with Chriſt bee neceſſarily joyned with death to ſin, then, where there is no life with Chriſt, there is no death to ſinne.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:108344:36"/>
               <p>You will ſay, how ſhall wee know that we are alive with Chriſt, and dead to ſin?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, you ſhall know it by three Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that which is the cauſe of ſpirituall life, as that which is the cauſe of naturall life, is union with that which is the principle and fountaine of life: Now the fountaine of life is Chriſt, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.12.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>He that hath the Sonne, hath life; hee that hath not the Sonne hath not life.</hi> Now what is it that unites us to Chriſt?<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> It is faith that knits us to Chriſt, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>The life that I live is by faith in the Son of God.</hi> Looke as the cauſe of the naturall life, is the union to the principle of naturall life: ſo the cauſe of ſpirituall life, is union to that which is the principle of ſpirituall life. Now the cauſe and fountaine of ſpirituall life is Chriſt, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle in this chapter verſe 11.<note place="margin">Rom 6.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Likewiſe reckon yee your ſelves dead to ſinne, but alive to God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> It is through Chriſt that wee are alive to God. Now I ſay, that that knits and unites us to the fountaine of ſpirituall life, it is Faith. Hee then that hath Faith, that man is alive to God, but hee that hath no faith, that man is dead in ſinne; that is the firſt character by which wee may know, whether we be alive with Chriſt or no, if we have this ſpirituall life.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:108344:37"/>
               <p>Secondly, we may know it if wee have the exerciſes of this ſpirituall life. Every thing delights to operate, and exerciſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to its life: where there is a naturall life, there is a delight in actions that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; where there is a ſinfull life, there is a delight in actions that are ſinfull. Take a man that ſinne lives and reignes in, it is life to ſuch a man to ſerve ſinne, to performe and ſatisfie his ſinfull luſts: ſo, where there is delight in performing ſpirituall duties, it is an undoubted argument that that man hath ſpirituall life in him. Take a man that delights in prayer, in hearing the Word, in contemplating, and meditating of Gods goodneſſe towards him, and in other ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall duties; this is an argument that that man hath ſpirituall life, becauſe he delights in ſpirituall actions.</p>
               <p>The ground of it is this, all delight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſimilitude, and conformity: wee delight in things that are like us: Now when a man is ſpirituall, there is ſome likeneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and ſpirituall actions, and ſo hee delights in them. Take a carnall, naturall man, he delights not in ſpirituall duties, it is death to him to doe that which is good: when he comes to betake himſelfe to prayer, to performe religious duties, to ſanctifie the Lords day, to keepe a watch over himſelfe, to checke his ſinfull luſts, it is death to a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108344:37"/> naturall man; Why? hee hath no delight in ſpirituall actions, becauſe hee hath nothing in him that is ſpirituall; all delight proceeds from likeneſſe and ſimilitude; that is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Character that wee have this ſpirituall life, if we delight in ſpirituall actions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, another Argument of ſpirituall life is, if we have the properties of life, and they are three as Philoſophers ſay.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The firſt is nouriſhment.</item>
                  <item>The ſecond is augmentation.</item>
                  <item>The third is generation, or production of the like.</item>
               </list>
               <p>So anſwerable, whereſoever there is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, in ſome proportion there is all theſe three.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is nouriſhment; <hi>As new borne babes deſire the ſincere milke of the Word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.2.</note> 2 Pet. 1.2. Where there is a new life, there is a deſire of the ſincere milke of the Word. Take a man, that is a dead man, hee deſires no meate, Why? there is no life in him. Now looke as a man that lives a naturall life, hee deſires naturall food: ſo hee that is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, hee that lives a ſpirituall life, hee hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and thirſts after the word. As where there is the life of ſinne in a man, that man deſires after all things that may fill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and preſerve that life in him; ſo in ſpirituall life there is a deſire after the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall food of the Word, to preſerve this life.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:108344:38"/>
               <p>The ground of it is this, God never gives any grace to a man, but hee gives a man a care, and indeavour to preſerve that grace: God never gives a man ſpirituall life, but he gives withall a deſire to preſerve that life. Now how can a man preſerve it? How ſhould a man preſerve life, but by food? by diligent repayring to the places, where the ſpirituall food of his ſoule is provided? It is with this ſpirituall life, as it was with the fire on the Altar:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The fire on the Altar, though it came from heaven, yet when it was kindled, they were bound to preſerve it by ordinary meanes, to put fuell to it: ſo when God hath kindled that ſpirituall life, wee muſt not turne off all the care on God, let God take care for the life hee hath wrought in us; but God will give a deſire to a man, to keepe that fire, to put continuall fuell to it, to preſerve and nouriſh it. That is the firſt propertie of life, to looke for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. God never gives a man grace, but he workes in that man a deſire, and indeavour to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propertie is Augmentation, and growth, and proceeding from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of grace to another, when wee find our ſelves more ſtrong to performe the duties that are ſpirituall, when wee find ſinne more weakened. This ſpirituall growth in grace, is a propertie of this ſpirituall life. If di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108344:38"/> Plants bee planted, if wee ſee ſome of them grow, and others doe not, wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this is dead, why? it growes not. As it is in nature, ſo it is in this ſpirituall life, where there is no growth, there is no life. Every thing that lives, hath the property of life, it hath the facultie of growing. Which I would notwithſtanding have to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: not, but that this life may admit of a Winter, there may bee an increaſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: but yet there is a continuall ſtrayning after perfection; Though ſometimes the ſtreame may be ſo ſtrong, that it may carry them downe: yet they bend their ſtrength againſt the ſtreame, they labour to grow up more and more. That is the ſecond proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of life, augmentation; where there is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, there is growth.</p>
               <p>The third is Generation, where there is life, there is a facultie and power to beget. As in a coale, a live coale will kindle a dead one; a dead coale cannot kindle another, there is no heat in it. So it is in this ſpirituall life, where it is, there is a deſire to beget others: as Chriſt ſaith; <hi>When thou art converted, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thy brethren.</hi> When thou haſt ſpirituall life begotten in thee, labour to beget it in others. Wee ſee it exemplified in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.44.<note place="margin">Joh. 1.44.</note> no ſooner had Chriſt called <hi>Philip,</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>Philip</hi> calls <hi>Nathaniel.</hi> No ſooner had Chriſt by his Word begotten ſpirituall life
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108344:39"/> in <hi>Philip,</hi> but <hi>Philip</hi> indeavours to beget the ſame in <hi>Nathaniel.</hi> This is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a live and a dead coale, a live coale can beget life in another coale, and kindle the ſame fire in another, but a dead coale cannot. That man that hath ſpirituall life in him, hee will improve all opportunities and occaſions that are offered to beget others to a ſpirituall life.</p>
               <p>The ground of it is, hee findes a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a goodneſſe in ſpirituall life, and that is the reaſon, out of love to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and an indeavour to glorifie God, he deſires to beget others to this ſpirituall life. This is the firſt uſe: The Characters by which we may know whether wee have this life or no.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if ſuch as be dead with Chriſt ſhall live with him. This ſhould be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſwade us to labour for death with Chriſt. Can any prize be propounded better to a man then life? what will not a man doe for life? S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his 45. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſaith hee, <hi>Wee ſee men indure death al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt for life, for the enjoying of it for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while.</hi> Shall men doe ſo for a naturall life? ſhall not wee much more for a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life? If theſe bee neceſſarily joyned, if he that is dead with Chriſt, ſhall certainly live with him: then this ſhould bee an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſwade us to die with Chriſt, that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108344:39"/> we may come to live with him. And this the rather, becauſe, by dying with Chriſt, wee ſhall enjoy, not onely a fading, periſhing, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life, but</p>
               <p>A
<list>
                     <item>Spirituall</item>
                     <item>Eternall</item>
                  </list> Life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a ſpirituall life, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.14.</note> it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the life of God,</hi> becauſe it reſembleth the life of God. Now that which is ſpirituall is more excellent than that which is naturall and corporall. The ground of it is this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nearer a thing approacheth to that which is more excellent, the more excellent that muſt be. Now the life ſpirituall as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth more neare to the life of God, the more excellent it muſt needes bee, it muſt needs bee more excellent then the naturall life, that is the firſt reaſon. By dying with Chriſt we ſhall live with Chriſt, not onely a naturall but a ſpirituall life, ſuch a life as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth nearer to God then the life of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſhall enjoy a life not fading and momentary, but an eternall life; for (as I ſayd) the difference betweene the life of grace and glory, is not in the nature but in the degrees; in whomſoever there is a ſparke of true grace begun, it will certainly hold out till it grow to a flame of immortality, if like the fire upon the Altar it bee nouriſhed with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108344:40"/> 
                  <hi>fuell,</hi> ſo that a man that is once dead with Chriſt, he ſhall not live onely a ſpirituall life for a while, but an eternall life in this world and in the world to come, and both theſe ſhould be arguments to ſtirre us up to labour for this death with Chriſt, becauſe wee ſhall live with him, not onely a ſpirituall life, but ſuch a ſpirituall life as is eternall. So much for the ſecond propoſition.</p>
               <p>Now I addreſſe my ſelfe to the third.</p>

            <div type="part">

                  <hi>We beleeve]</hi> Or we are perſwaded, or wee are aſſured ſaith Cardinall <hi>Caietane,</hi> upon this place <hi>wee are undoubtedly aſſured.</hi> The word in this place is a word of affiance and confidence; As if he had ſayd in more words thus, not onely the thing is ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in it ſelfe, that they that are dead with Chriſt ſhall live with him; for ſo many things are ſure and certaine in themſelves, and yet wee may remaine uncertaine of them. The reaſon is, becauſe the aſſurance of them proceedes, not ſo much from the certainty of the thing, as from our apprehending and knowing that certainty. It is not a thing onely ſure in it ſelfe, but it is a thing whereof they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſure and certaine: <hi>If we be dead with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108344:40"/> Chriſt, we beleeve,</hi> we are perſwaded or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>that we ſhall live with Chriſt.</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, the concluſion is,
<q>That the knowledge of a mans owne mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth ſeale up to a mans ſoule and conſcience the aſſurance of his ſalvation.</q> Or thus.
<q>They that are dead with Chriſt, may beleeve or reſt aſſured that they ſhall alſo live with him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Not onely with the life of grace (although as I heretofore proved, from the ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle in this place; this life the Apoſtle principally intends; for this they actually doe, <hi>they that are dead with Chriſt</hi> actually for the preſent <hi>live to God, verſ.</hi> 11.) but they ſhall live alſo the other life of glory: <hi>they that are dead with Chriſt may be aſſured that they ſhall live, with the life of glory,</hi> not onely of grace here, but of glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>Where firſt, that you may not miſtake or miſconſture me, obſerve. I doe not ſay that he that is dead with Chriſt, or mortified, is preſently aſſured that hee ſhall live with Chriſt. The reaſon is becauſe a man may be mortified, and yet not know that hee is mortified at ſome time. Now our aſſurance ſprings not ſo much from our mortification as from the aſſurance, and knowledge of our mortification; In which reſpect it is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108344:41"/> for thoſe that are babes in Chriſt, and young beginners, to make doubt and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their title to heaven, as the aged alſo in Chriſt ſometimes may doe. The reaſon is, becauſe though they be mortified in part, yet becauſe grace is weake it is almoſt undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, in reſpect of the infinite maſſe of corruption. In which reſpect it is with them as it is with the Marriners needle, which though it be truly touched, yet it takes not the North point at the firſt,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but it firſt ſhakes and trembles, and then is fixed: So a man that is regenerate, and mortified preſently as ſoone as he is regenerate, he is not aſſured of ſalvation, but firſt ſhakes and trembles, there is a kinde of ſpirituall palſey, a trepedation in the ſoule. The reaſon is not becauſe of mortification, it proceeds not from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, but becauſe mortification is weak, therefore he cannot have great aſſurance, for aſſurance comes from the long continuance, and experience of the power and practiſe of mortification.</p>
               <p>And as it is in young beginners in reſpect of the weakeneſſe of grace, ſo it may be in a growne man in Chriſt in reſpect of the ſtrength of temptation. He that hath beene aſſured of his ſalvation by the evidence of his owne conſcience, and Gods Spirit, that he hath the beginnings in truth and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mortification, yet he may have his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108344:41"/> interrupted, there may be a kinde of interpoſition, he may looſe it in reſpect of the preſent ſenſe and apprehenſion of aſſurance.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Iuſt as it is with the Sunne, ſo long as the Sunne is continued, ſo long there is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ground and cauſe of light: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diſcerning and perceiving of the light may be taken from us by the night, or by an eclipſe, or by clouds, that may take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſight of the Sunne. Iuſt ſo it is with a regenerate man, a mortified man, hee that is not onely a babe in Chriſt, and hath made ſome beginning in the courſe of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but he that is a growne man, and gone on in the practice of mortification, yet notwithſtanding he may come to doubt and queſtion his ſalvation, and his right to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſometimes. The reaſon is becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by reaſon of temptations, or after the committing of ſome great and haynous ſinne, mortification in him may be clouded for a time, ſo that hee may looſe his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the preſent ſenſe and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that aſſurance that may bee loſt for a time.</p>
               <p>Iuſt as it was in Chriſt when hee was on the Croſſe in combate for our ſakes, hee ſeemes to have loſt for the preſent, the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and apprehenſion of Gods love, hee ſayd, <hi>My God my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The vaileing of the dietie was a kind of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108344:42"/> diſſertion, and forſaking of Chriſt, in reſpect of evidence and aſſurance, yet hee had the ground of his aſſurance ſtill; the humanitie of Chriſt was individually and inſeparably united to the God-head, which was the ground of this aſſurance. I ſay then it is not every man that is mortified that hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently aſſurance of ſalvation; no, nor every man that once hath had aſſurance of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that hath this aſſurance alway: it hath eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and tides, wanes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </label> I anſwer, a man may know it three wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the Word of God, which God hath left as a Teſt or Touch-ſtone, whereby men may try the ſinceritie and truth of their mortification. Heretofore I have given ſome notes, and characters (whereby ye may diſcerne whether you are mortified or no) out of the Scriptures. The firſt thing whereby we may try the truth of our mortification is the Scripture, <hi>which God hath left to bee a light to our feete, and a Lanthorne to our paths,</hi> to bee a Touch-ſtone whereby wee
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108344:43"/> may diſcover whether our mortification bee ſincere or counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is another teſtimonie, and that is the teſtimonie of our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when the conſcience being renewed and ſanctified, conſcience beares witneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, out of long experience of the truth, and ſinceritie of mortification, that wee are mortified: for this aſſurance, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from mortification, ariſeth not from one act, but from long experience of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Now any man knowes, that knowes the nature of experience, that that ariſeth from many acts. The ſecond meanes then to know we are mortified, it is from the teſtimonie of our owne conſcience, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16.</note> that beares witneſſe <hi>that wee are the children of God,</hi> that we are mortified.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, there comes another teſtimonie as a meanes, and that aſſures the reſt, that is of Gods Spirit, that calmes the conſcience, and perſwades of this, that wee are mortified, and ſo by conſequent that wee have right to heaven. That is the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then, hee that is mortified, that is dead with Chriſt, hee is aſſured to live with him; becauſe God hath promiſed life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſuch as are dead with Chriſt; and ſuch as are dead with Chriſt, they may know themſelves at one time or other to bee dead with Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:108344:44"/>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> Secondly, Mortification ſeales up to a man the aſſurance of ſalvation, becauſe it ſeales to a man the aſſurance of his being in Chriſt. The argument is this, hee that may be aſſured that hee is in Chriſt, may bee aſſured that hee ſhall be ſaved: but hee that knowes that hee is mortified, and dead with Chriſt, hee may be aſſured that hee is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Chriſt: therefore he may be aſſured that hee ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I aske, whence comes this death with Chriſt? Whence comes it that ſinne is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in a man? Is it not becauſe hee is in Chriſt, and is united to Chriſt? and thence it is becauſe hee is united to Chriſt, that hee partakes of the vertue, and Spirit of Chriſt, whereby ſinne is mortified; Let this bee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bee ſpoken for the proofe of the point.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> In the firſt place, it ſerves for confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for if they that are dead with Chriſt may be aſſured by this, that they ſhall alſo live with Chriſt. Then ſurely a man may attaine a greater aſſurance of ſalvation, then <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and the reſt of that faction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men he may. They ſay a man cannot attaine it by the contemplating, and viewing of the grace of God in him, hee can but attaine a kind of hope of ſalvation; a kind of doubting, conjecturall, morall aſſurance; but for this aſſurance that we ſpeake of, our
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108344:44"/> Countrey-men at <hi>Rhemes</hi> ſticke not to ſay that it is a damnable falſe thing, upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rhem.</hi> on Rom. 9.</note> ſuch an aſſurance as is impoſſible to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this life, except it be by revelation, and by extraordinary meanes. And then they ſay moreover, if it bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ttained, it is peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and dangerous to attaine: becauſe it opens to men, a gappe to all licentiouſneſſe; for ſay they, if a man may be aſſured of his ſalvation; let him doe what he will, hee ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I cannot now enter into the liſts with theſe Rhemiſts at this time, but give me leave to their objection to returne two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, (ſay they) it is impoſſible for a man by mortification, to come to be aſſured of his ſalvation. I deſire them to unriddle me this; They ſay, a man by mortifying, by macerating himſelfe, by faſting and ſack-cloth, and by whipping himſelfe, hee may merit ſalvation and heaven; May hee merit heaven, and not bee aſſured hee ſhall come to heaven? What? is it becauſe God is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and knowes not their good deeds? or becauſe hee is unjuſt, and will not reward them? If they ſay either, it is blaſphemie, if they give way to either of them, then they give way to this doctrine that wee ſpeake of. If a man by macerating himſelfe, in ſack-cloth and aſhes, by whipping, and bearing himſelfe, may merit heaven (as the Papiſts
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108344:45"/> joyntly affirme, or moſt of them; And <hi>Get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> in his ſecond booke of Diſcipline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chap. 8.) then certainly a man, by mortification may come to have aſſurance of heaven: for if a man bee not aſſured, but doubts, that doubt muſt come, that either God knowes not that wee deſerve heaven, by our morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and then God is not omniſcient; Or if hee doe know it, hee will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us according to our merits, and then hee is unjuſt; either of which to affirme is blaſphemy. So their owne tenent over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes themſelves. See the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene truth and errour, one truth and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue contraries not another, but one vice and errour contradict each other: as Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe oppoſeth Prodigalitie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſay they, as it is impoſſible to attaine, ſo it is dangerous to attaine, this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a gappe to licentiouſneſſe. I wonder what feare there is of this, ſince wee affirme that this aſſurance is to bee had by holineſſe, by mortifying of our ſinfull luſts. It is true indeed, if we had aſſurance, if we did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that it might bee gotten, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that we went on in the practice of our ſinfull luſts, then it were another matter: but wee affirme that this aſſurance is had only by the practice of mortification, by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and ſubduing our ſinfull luſts. And as it is gained by this, ſo it is to be preſerved
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108344:45"/> by this. I wonder then what feare here can be of opening a gappe to licentiouſneſſe and wickedneſſe, by maintaining aſſurance of ſalvation, when we maintaine here with, that aſſurance is had by mortification, and is to be kept, and preſerved only by it. The rule of Philoſophy here is true, the ſame cauſe that produceth, the ſame cauſe preſerveth a thing: but to let them paſſe and to returne to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>If thoſe that are dead with Chriſt, may <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> come to be aſſured, that they ſhall alſo live with him, how ſhould this ſtirre up all of us to labour for mortification! To indeavour to ſubdue and mortifie our ſinfull luſts, that we may come to bee aſſured, that after wee ſhall live with God! It is that that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle commands, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. ſaith he,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure. Give diligence,</hi> it is not a thing ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attained as ſome dreame, it is a thing that requires coſt and paines; a man hath it not but after long practiſe and indeavour of mortification. Now, I ſay, it is that that the Apoſtle perſwades us unto, to give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make our Calling and election ſure. It is ſure enough in Gods counſell, we ſhould labour to make it ſure in our owne conſcience. Wee may complaine, men give diligence to make their houſes ſure, to make their lands, and preferments, and offices, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108344:46"/> friends ſure, but how few give diligence to make their Calling and election ſure?</p>
               <p>Yet I know not when there was ever more need, that wee of this place ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make our calling and election ſure then now, wee perceive already that wrath is gone out from God, and the Angell of the Lord hath ſtrucken ſome among us, and they have fallen on the right hand, and on the left hand before us, and behind us, and wee our ſelves know not when our turne may come. Now the leſſe aſſurance we have of being here on earth, the more wee ſhould labour for aſſurance of our well being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in heaven. And if wee have once this aſſurance, this will beſtead us, and miniſter comfort in all calamities. What though we bee poore, if wee have this aſſurance, wee know wee ſhall come there, where there is durable, unperiſhing riches: What if we be in diſgrace? this will make us poſſeſſe our ſoules with patience, and tell us that we ſhall come ſhortly to a place where wee are aſſured, all teares ſhall be wiped from our eyes, and all that blemiſheth our name: What though we bee ſicke? wee are aſſured that wee ſhall come to a place where we ſhall have no ſickneſſe but conſtant health. What though death come? It will make us chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to welcome it, and it will make us call it as Saint <hi>Ciprian</hi> doth,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
                  </note> the Midwife of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108344:46"/> immortalitie, that ſhall tranſlate and remove us from a fading periſhing life, to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. Then let us (that God hath bin ſo gracious unto, that he hath ſpared us, and viſited others,) labour to improve the time to practiſe mortification, that in caſe worſe come, wee may yet be provided. If wee adreſſe our ſelves to this, who knowes if God will not graciouſly ſpare us, and not afflict us: or if it come, wee ſhall have infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite comfort, then when our dores ſhall bee ſhut up, and we have no other comfort, yet then our conſcience will witneſſe comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that notwithſtanding wee die, yet wee ſhall come where wee ſhall live for ever. Oh then, as the Apoſtle ſaith, let us <hi>give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make our calling and election ſure.</hi> It is a matter of paines, it is not eaſily gotten, but it will abundantly recompence the paines. If wee looke, and finde our ſinfull luſts mortified in part, let not that ſatisfie us, let us not reſt there, but goe further, and proceed in the worke of mortification: for looke as our mortification is, ſo is our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: the weaker our mortification is, the weaker our aſſurance of ſalvation; the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger our mortification, the better aſſurance wee have of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if they that are dead with <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> Chriſt, may reſt aſsured that they ſhall live with him: then by the rule of contraries,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108344:47"/> they that are not dead with Chriſt cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelves that they ſhall live with him. If only he can be aſſured of ſalvation in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinfull luſts are mortified, then hee in whom they are not mortified, that man cannot bee aſſured of ſalvation. Indeed hee may have a kinde of a wilde hope, a preſumptuous confidence, but it is ſuch as will faile him in the time of need. Like to your Winter brookes, or land-floods; In the time of Winter when a man hath no uſe of water they flow abundantly; but in Summer, in the time of drought, when men have need, they are gone, they are not to bee had. So that aſſurance that a man hath, as long as hee goes on in the practice of his ſinfull luſts, it is a wild, deceitfull preſumption, ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance as will doe him no good when hee comes to need it.</p>
               <p>I have read it was the manner of tryall that was uſed, when there was a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of land, whether it belonged to <hi>Ireland,</hi> or to <hi>England,</hi> they did take Snakes, and Toades, and poyſonous Serpents, and put there, and if they lived there, they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it belonged to <hi>England,</hi> if they died, they judged it belonged to <hi>Ireland:</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, becauſe no venemous thing will live there. I apply it thus, ſinfull luſts are like Snakes and Toades, and venemous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: looke what ſoule they live in, if they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108344:47"/> live in a mans ſoule, it is an argument that hee belongs not to heaven, and wee know what place he belongs to then, onely to hell, if it dye in us, we may aſſure our ſelves that wee belong to heaven. Hee in whom ſinne lives, and his luſts continue unmortified, that man cannot aſſure himſelfe of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe all aſſurance comes from the promiſe of God; God hath made no promiſe to men that continue and goe on in the ſervice and obedience of their ſinfull luſts, hee threatens nothing but death and deſtruction to ſuch, <hi>If yee live after the fleſh yee ſhall dye, Rom.</hi> 8.13.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> This ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the third point the certainty of this connexion, <hi>If we be dead with Chriſt, we beleeve that we ſhall alſo live with him.</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification ſeales up to a mans ſoule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the aſſurance of ſalvation: for they that are dead with Chriſt may reſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and perſwaded that they ſhall live with him.</p>
               <p>I come to the fourth and laſt point, The cauſe and ground of this death to ſinne and this life to grace, which is Chriſt, <hi>If wee be dead with Chriſt, we beleeve that we ſhall alſo live with him: If we be dead with Chriſt,</hi> that is, if we be dead by the vertue and power of Chriſt, then wee beleeve that wee ſhall alſo live by vertue and power of the ſame Chriſt. The concluſion is this, that,
<q>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:108344:48"/>As our death to ſinne ſo our life to grace, they both proceede from Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If we be dead with Chriſt ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that is, if wee be dead by the vertue and power of Chriſt: if ſinne be dead in us, then wee beleeve that wee ſhall alſo live with Chriſt the life of grace here, and of glory hereafter, by the power and vertue of the ſame Chriſt. I ſay, the point on which I ſhall inſiſt is this, that as our death to ſinne, ſo the life of Grace, they both proceede from Chriſt, Chriſt is the author and the producer of both. So ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, yet notwithſtanding I live, yet not I but Chriſt liveth in mee, and the life that I live in the fleſh is by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelfe for me.</hi> Looke what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of himſelfe, the ſame may every Chriſtian (in whom ſinne is dead and mortified, and the life of grace wrought) ſpeake of himſelfe, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt,</hi> that is, ſin is crucified in me, ſinfull luſts are crucified and mortified in me by the vertue of Chriſt, ſo ſaith he, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> As I am crucified to ſinne by Chriſt, ſo I live by the vertue of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8, 9, 10</note> So in <hi>Phillip.</hi> 3.8,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108344:48"/> 9, 10. He deſires ſo earneſtly to be found in Chriſt that he contemned and undervalued all things but this, that he might be found in Chriſt, ſaith he, <hi>I account all loſſe for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge of Chriſt, for whom I ſuffer the loſſe of all things,</hi> nay I account them not onely <hi>loſſe but dung, that I may winne Chriſt and be found in him,</hi> we ſee in verſe 10. the reaſon, <hi>that I may know him and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being made conformable to his death.</hi> The reaſon why the Apoſtle deſired to be found in Chriſt, and why in compariſon of this he accounted all things as droſſe, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he might bee made partaker of Chriſts death. What is the fellowſhip of Chriſts death, but to bee partaker of the Spirit of Chriſt that raiſed him from the dead that by the ſame Spirit of Chriſt hee might bee ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the death of ſinne to the life of grace.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of it is this, becauſe as our death to ſinne, ſo our life to grace, are both the worke of grace, from whom can wee expect the worke of grace, but from him in whom is the fulneſſe of grace? ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn Ioh</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.14.</note> (that is, <hi>Chriſt) and dwelt among us, and wee ſaw his glory, as the glory of the onely begotten Sonne of God full of grace and truth.</hi> Our death to ſin and our life to Chriſt are both the effects of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108344:49"/> Gods grace: Now from whom can we have the effects of Gods grace, but from him in whom alone is the fulneſſe of grace? The word was made manifeſt among us, in whom is the fulneſſe of truth and grace. Look as it is in the naturall body ſo it is in the miſticall body, as in the naturall body all the naturall motion proceeds from the head, and from the vertue that is derived from the head to the members; ſo in the myſticall body, all the ſpirituall motion it proceeds from the influence of the head; Chriſt is the head, and from him as from the head, is derived all the vertue to the members of Chriſt, by which the death to ſinne, and the life of grace is wrought in us likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Looke as it was in the oyle of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the oyle that was powred on the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> it ſtayd not on his head, but deſcended to the skirts of his cloathing: So the Spirit of Chriſt, it reſts not on Chriſt onely, but from Chriſt as the head, it deſcends upon all the members of Chriſt: The reaſon thereof, why as our death to ſinne, ſo the life of grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Chriſt, is becauſe both are the workes of grace, according to that of the Evangeliſt, in him dwells all the fulneſſe of grace, and in <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 2. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In him dwells the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily.</hi> For the better and fuller opening of the point, give me leave to propoſe, and reſolve
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108344:49"/> one queſtion, and that is this.<label type="milestone">

                  </label> If our death to ſinne, and our life of grace both proceede from Chriſt, that Chriſt is the author of them actions, then how is Chriſt the author of them? what kinde of cauſe is Chriſt ſayd to be both of our death to ſinne, and of the life of grace?</p>
               <p>I anſwer briefly,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> Chriſt may be ſayd to be the cauſe both of our death to ſin and of the life of grace, in a fourefold reſpect, or hee is a fourefold kind of cauſe.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is the
<list>
                     <item>1 meritorious</item>
                     <item>2 exemplary</item>

                  </list> Cauſe as of our death to ſin, ſo likewiſe of our life to grace.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe; for Chriſt did by his death and obedience, not onely purchaſe for us a releaſe and freedome from hell, and conſequently title to heaven, but Chriſt merited for us, the donation of the Spirit of God, whereby we are made fit for, and capable of that inheritance. Chriſt not onely purchaſed a right to heaven, but grace &amp; holines, whereby we might come at laſt to <hi>jus in re:</hi> For as I ſayd before, by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of Chriſt onely we come to have right to heaven, but it is our owne righteouſneſſe, whereby we come to be made capable of that right to heaven, for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>fleſh and blood ſhal not enter into the kingdome of heaven.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108344:50"/> Fleſh and blood,</hi> that is, nature uncorrected, unſanctified, and uncontrolled it ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdome of God; therefore Chriſt hath purchaſed not onely redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from hell, and title to heaven, but the donation of the Spirit of God, whereby we are made fit and capable of heaven, whereby <hi>wee are made meete,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>to be partakers of the inheritance with the Saints in light.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.19.</note> So ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.19. <hi>For their ſakes</hi> ſaith our Saviour <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelfe, that they alſo may be ſanctified through the truth.</hi> Chriſt ſanctified himſelfe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to redeeme us from hell, and to procure title to heaven, but he ſanctified himſelfe that his members might bee ſanctified, that by the merit and vertue of Chriſts ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we might be ſanctified. So ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> he hath beſtowed on us the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit through Chriſt,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>not by the workes of righteouſneſſe that wee had done, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration and the renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly through Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> It is through Chriſt onely, as through the meritorious cauſe; by whom wee obtaine the Spirit of God, by which Spirit our ſinfull luſts are mortified in us, and by which we are quickned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived to the life of grace, ſo Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe, hee deſerved the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108344:50"/> of the Spirit from his Father.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt as hee is the meritorious ſo he is the exemplary cauſe, as of death to ſinne, ſo of our life to grace. Chriſt in dying to ſinne he ſet himſelfe as a patterne to us, to teach us alſo that wee ſhould dye to ſinne. Chriſt in riſing from the grave hee ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a patterne to us to teach us to riſe from ſinne, ſo he is the exemplary cauſe.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt is a patterne for our immitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his morall actions, and wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble after a ſort ſome of his Mediatorious actions alſo; not onely in the good duties that are commanded in the Law, but in thoſe that he performed for our redemption; It is true in a different manner. Chriſt is a patterne to us in actions morall, that is in the good things that he performed that are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Law, he is our patterne to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in the ſame kinde: As Chriſt was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the poore, ſo ſhould wee to them that are poore, and in diſtreſſe in the ſame kind; as he was temperate ſo may wee imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in the ſame kinde, though not in the ſame degree. But for his actions Mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, we are to reſemble ſome of them too, though not in the ſame kinde, yet in ſome way of uſe. As hee died for ſinne, ſo wee ſhould dye to ſinne, as he roſe from the grave ſo wee ſhould riſe from ſinne to newneſſe of life: ſo ſtill Chriſt is our patterne. As Saint
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108344:51"/> 
                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, Chriſt came not onely to helpe us, and to performe the things that wee ought to have done, but he came to teach us by his example what we ought to do And he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, us, he is our Schoolemaſter not only in his actions morall, but in his actions mediatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; in the former we may imitate him in the ſame kind, though we cannot in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in the latter wee cannot imitate him in the ſame kinde, yet in ſome ſort wee may.</p>
               <p>We ſhould be as the <hi>Heletropium,</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens and ſhuts with the Sunne, ſo wee may <hi>follow the lambe whereſoever he goeth,</hi> as hee dyed for ſinne ſo we muſt dye to ſinne, as hee roſe from the grave ſo we muſt riſe from the death of ſinne to newneſſe of life, ſo Chriſt is the exemplary cauſe of our death to ſinne, and the life of grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is the morall, moving, perſwading cauſe of both. That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle wills <hi>Timothy</hi> to remember, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Remember,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt of the ſeede of David, was raiſed from the dead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Goſpel:</hi> he bids him remember it, why remember it? becauſe the very thought and remembrance that Chriſt dyed and roſe againe, it cannot chuſe but be a powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to holineſſe, for it makes men conclude &amp; argue with themſelves; what did Chriſt lay downe his life for us, and ſhall not wee lay
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108344:51"/> downe our luſts for him? Did Chriſt ariſe againe the third day from the Grave, and ſhall not wee riſe from the death of ſinne, to newneſſe of life? Doe wee profeſſe our ſelves to bee members of Chriſt, and not indeavour conformitie with our head Chriſt? Shall wee be like the Image or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> to have a head of gold, and to have feet of mire and clay? So, Chriſt is not only the meritorious, and exemplary, but the moving, perſwading cauſe: the very thought, that Chriſt died for ſin, and roſe againe, it will move us to die to ſin, and to live the life of grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Chriſt is the cauſe efficient, as of our death to ſinne, ſo of the life of grace. It were in vaine, that Chriſt were the meritorious cauſe, that hee had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the donation of Gods Spirit, whereby ſinne might be killed, and wee be quickened to the life of grace. It were in vaine for him to ſet himſelfe as a patterne for us to imitate; and that hee is a morall cauſe to move, and perſwade us to imitate him, unleſſe hee were alſo the cauſe efficient, to worke in us this <hi>death to ſinne,</hi> and this <hi>life of Grace:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt alſo is the efficient cauſe hee workes in us, both a <hi>death to ſinne,</hi> and the <hi>life of grace.</hi> For the underſtanding of which, know, that Chriſt not only ſaves us by merit, but hee ſaves us by efficacie too;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108344:52"/> not only by Merite in deſerving of life for us: but in efficacie in fitting, and preparing us to partake of life. Hee not only by death hath aboliſhed, and removed death for ſin; but hee abates in us daily the power of ſinne, ſo hee is the efficient cauſe as well as the reſt.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Thoſe that concurre to the firſt worke are three;
<list>
                     <item>1. The Spirit of God.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now thoſe againe that concurre not to the firſt worke of our death to ſinne, and kindling of this ſpirituall life, but to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe; and augmentation of it, when it is wrought: they are two;

                  </list>

               <p>Of every one of theſe briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, the principall cauſe of <hi>death to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108344:52"/> ſinne,</hi> and of the <hi>life of grace,</hi> is the Spirit of Chriſt, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle in that place before alledged, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12.13. ſaith he,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> 
                  <hi>If yee live after the fleſh yee ſhall die, but if yee mortifie the deedes of the body through the Spirit, yee ſhall live.</hi> It is through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt whereby ſinne is mortified in us, and through the Spirit of Chriſt that we are quickned to the <hi>life of grace.</hi> In which reſpect it is called the quickning Spirit: ſaith Chriſt <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. <hi>The ſpirit quickneth.</hi>

Why is it called the Sanctifying ſpirit? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by it we are ſanctified. Now what are the parts of Sanctification? They are two, firſt our death to ſinne, the ſubduing of the power of ſinne: ſecondly, our enlivening and quickning to grace. Now the Spirit of God is ſaid to be a ſanctifying Spirit in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of both theſe: for from the Spirit of God it is that ſinne is mortified in us; and it is from the quickning Spirit, that we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened to a new life, ſo the principall cauſe is the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>There are two other cauſes, and thoſe are inſtrumentall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Word of God, that is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes whereby God workes in us this <hi>death to ſinne,</hi> and <hi>the life of grace;</hi> it is a powerfull meanes that God uſeth, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>for the battering, and demolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108344:53"/> of all Satans ſtrong holds.</hi> Our luſts of themſelves are too ſtrong for us to vanquiſh, it is the Spirit only that is mightier, that can vanquiſh them: but by what meanes doth the Spirit doe it? It is by the Spirit as the principall cauſe, but by the Word, as the inſtrumentall cauſe, or by the Spirit of God concurring with the Word. For the Word of it ſelfe is not of power to mortifie ſinne, and to quicken us to a new life of grace: but as it is a meanes to convey, and derive to us the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>It is with us as it was with <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he was raiſed from the grave to a new life: hee was raiſed by the word of Chriſt; it was indeed by the word of Chriſt; but it was not only the word of Chriſt that raiſed him: but the vertue of Chriſts Spirit went along with that word, and made that effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall for the raiſing of him. So it is with us, it is not the Word only that is available for the mortifying of our ſinfull luſts, or that quickens us to the performance of the holy duties of a new life: but the Word as it is the inſtrument of the Spirit of God which is the chiefe Agent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another inſtrumentall cauſe is Baptiſme, that alſo is a meanes whereby the Spirit of God workes in us this <hi>death to ſin,</hi> and <hi>life of grace:</hi> Now Baptiſme is a cauſe of both theſe three wayes.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:108344:53"/>
               <p>Firſt, as it is a cauſe reſembling, or as a type, ſhadowing and pointing out to us, <hi>our death to ſinne,</hi> and <hi>our life of grace:</hi> which type and reſemblance was farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in hotter clymates and Countreys; in which in Baptiſme they uſed to drench the child, to dippe it in the water, which dip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping of the child in the water, was a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and type to them, of their death to ſinne with Chriſt: and their riſing out of the water, expreſt their riſing to newneſſe of life; ſo by Baptiſme wee are ſaid to bee dead to ſinne, and alive to God through it, as a reſemblance expreſſing to us this death and life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, not only as a reſemblance, but as a ſpeciall meanes whereby the Spirit of God concurres, and goes along with the Element of water, and makes it effectuall for the cleanſing of us, as from the guilt of ſin; ſo for the ſubduing the power of ſinne, and working in us a new life: in which reſpect it is ſtiled by the Apoſtle in <hi>Titus</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Tit 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The laver of regeneration;</hi> that is, it is that meanes whereby the Spirit of God workes regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>this death to ſinne, and life of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, Baptiſme is ſaid to be a cauſe, as of <hi>our death to ſinne, ſo of the life of grace,</hi> in regard of the ſtipulation or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: becauſe when wee are baptiſed, wee enter into a ſolemne vow, and covenant with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108344:54"/> God, that we will forſake the Divell and all his workes: there is mortification; and that wee will lead a new life, there is vivification. So it is ſaid to be a cauſe in regard of the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, and contract that wee make then, ſolemnly by our ſelves, or by thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for us that are our ſureties, our God-fathers, and God-mothers: It is a meanes in that regard. Let this ſuffice to be ſpoken of the meanes whereby Chriſt as an efficient cauſe, workes this death of ſinne, and life of grace.</p>
               <p>Before I paſſe, let me tell you, as by theſe cauſes, this death to ſinne, and life of grace is wrought: ſo there are other cauſes that ſerve not to kindle this ſacred ſparke, but to increaſe it, and make it grow to a flame: ſuch meanes as doe not ſerve for the performing of the firſt act of mortification and vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but when once there is mortification, and quickning in the ſoule, they increaſe both, and thoſe are principally two;
<list>
                     <item>1. Faith.</item>
                     <item>2. The Lords Supper.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2.12.</note>Firſt, Faith, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, in <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Yee are buried with Chriſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, wherein you are riſen with him through the faith of the operation of God.</hi> I ſay, faith is not the meanes to give us the firſt aſſault, and impreſſion upon ſinne, to mortifie, and ſubdue it at the firſt: but when we are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108344:54"/> Faith helpes, and increaſeth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that worke of mortification. So that the ſophiſme of our adverſaries is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: ſay they, if wee bee riſen through Chriſt, to a new life of grace, and through faith: then ſay they, wee have Faith before wee be quickned, for ſay they, that which is the cauſe of the effect, muſt goe before, as the cauſe of that effect. Now if Faith bee a meanes to raiſe us to a new life, then before wee have a new life, we have Faith; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Yee are riſen with him, through the faith of the operation of God:</hi> therefore wee have Faith before wee can riſe. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, with <hi>Ameſius;</hi> Faith is not the cauſe of the firſt mortification, but the cauſe of the increaſe of mortification; it is not that by which at the firſt wee are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but when once wee are quickned, it is that by which the worke of vivification is more and more increaſed. Conceive it thus, The worke of grace, is only the fruit, and effect of the Spirit of grace. Now when the Spirit of God enlivens, and quickens us, it begets in us, as other graces, ſo the grace of faith; Now when this grace of faith is wrought in us, by this wee are united more to Chriſt then before, and ſo partake more of the vertue of Chriſt, and ſo the worke of Mortification, and vivification is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. Faith then concurres not to the firſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108344:55"/> act of mortification, and vivification, but it concurres to the increaſe, and augmentation of both.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes or cauſe that concurres not to the firſt act, but to the increaſe of mortification and vification, it is the Lords Supper: for that ſerves (as the antient Father calls it) as phyſicke received into the body, not only for the checking and curbing, and expelling of obnoxious humours, but for the reſtoring of health by conſequent: ſo the Lords Supper duly received, it ſerves as a meanes to abate ſinfull luſts in us, if it bee worthily received I ſay, not by a dead faith; hee that receives it worthily, it is a meanes to mortifie ſinne in him, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, for the quickning of him to a new life, the life of grace, though not to the firſt act, yet to the increaſe of that former life that was in him. It is called meate. Now as the meate that wee receive cannot availe to beget a new life in a man: put meat into the mouth of a dead man, it doth not quicken him: put meate into the mouth of a living man, and it increaſeth his life. So in the Lords Supper worthily received; it is not a meanes to worke the firſt act of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and vivification, but when once Mortification and vivification are begun, when there is a new life in a man: this ſerves as ſpirituall food to ſtrengthen and increaſe that life.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:108344:55"/>
               <p>Let this ſuffice for the anſwer to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoſed, If Chriſt bee the cauſe of death to ſinne, and of the life of grace how hee is the cauſe; hee is the cauſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, the exemplary, the morall, and efficient cauſe: hee is the cauſe efficient, both by his Spirit, by his Word and by Baptiſme. And then he is the cauſe efficient though not of the firſt act of mortification, and vivification, yet of the increaſe of them, that is, by Faith, and the Lords Supper. I come briefly to the uſe.</p>
               <p>Well, if through Chriſt alone,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> and by vertue derived from him as a head wee die to ſinne, and live to grace, then this ſerves to ſtirre us all up to deſire and indeavour to bee in Chriſt, that wee may partake of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſt, whereby ſinne may bee killed in us, and mortified; and whereby wee may be quickned to the life of grace. It was the deſire of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the glory of him too, hee profeſſed that hee had rather be a member of Chriſt, then the Lord and King of the Empire. Now if wee deſire to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the vertue of Chriſt, our firſt care muſt be, to labour to be in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For looke as it is with a Plant, it partakes not of the vertue of the ſtocke till it be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it, and then it doth; ſo it is with us if we be grafted into Chriſt wee ſhall partake of the vertue of Chriſt, by which ſinne will
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108344:56"/> be mortified in us, and we ſhall be quickned to a new life of grace. As it is in the naturall body, the members partake not of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the head, unleſſe they be united to the head; ſo it is with us, except wee be united to Chriſt through a true and lively faith, (which is the ſinew and ligament by which we are tyed to Chriſt) we doe not partake of the vertue of Chriſt. Indeede many of us deſire the favour of great ones, to receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from them: but there is no man, no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch on the earth by whom wee can reape that benefit as we may by Chriſt if we be in him.</p>
               <p>We acknowledge that Kings are Lords of life and death; yet they are not Lords of this life and death. All the Kings and Monarchs in the world, though they may take away the life of their ſubjects, yet they cannot take away the life of one luſt or ſinne; though perhaps they may give life to a man, that is, not to take it away when they may, yet they cannot give a new life to a man, they cannot worke this new life the life of grace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould bee our deſire and indeavour to be in Chriſt, that wee may partake of the vertue of Chriſt, ſince it is onely hee from whom the vertue comes, by which ſinne is mortified, and wee are quickned to a new life.<note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> Let us labour to bee in him that wee may partake of this vertue. In <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108344:56"/> It is called a <hi>fountaine opened for ſinne, and for trangreſsion.</hi> Chriſt is not onely a pond or a poole that is dryed up, but a fountaine and perpetuall ſpring; if wee deſire to have our ſoules waſhed from corruption and ſinne, let us labour to waſh them in this living ſpring and fountaine. And then it is a fountaine opened, not a <hi>ſealed foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> as wee reade in Scripture. And then againe, as it is a fountaine opened for the killing of ſinne, ſo for the quickning to a new life. Looke as it was with that River that <hi>Naaman</hi> waſhed himſelfe in, he was not onely cleanſed of his Leproſie, but his fleſh came againe as the fleſh of a childe; ſo every one that is waſhed in the blood of Chriſt he is not onely cleanſed from the Leproſie, and corruption of ſinne, but his fleſh comes as the fleſh of a childe; the life that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had in <hi>Adam,</hi> comes againe to him by the vertue of Chriſt. That is the firſt Vſe; if our death to ſinne, and life in grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede both from Chriſt, this ſhould be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to us to labour to be in Chriſt, that we may die to ſinne and live with him.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if our death to ſinne,<note place="margin">To returne the prayſe of grace to Chriſt.</note> and life in grace proceede from Chriſt, then when wee finde in our ſelves ſinne in any ſort mortified, and that wee are inabled to performe holy duties; wee know from whom wee have it; let us know to whom
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108344:57"/> we ought to returne the glory of it. Let us ſay as <hi>David, through thee we have done va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly.</hi> It is through Chriſt, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from him that wee overcome our luſts, or elſe they are too ſtrong for us. If wee be enabled to doe holy duties, let us lift up our eyes to heaven, and ſay, through thee O Chriſt wee are enabled to doe this. As all the vertue whereby wee dye to ſinne, and live the life of grace is from Chriſt, ſo it is equall that all the glory ſhould bee returned to Chriſt. It is the greateſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge in the world, to attribute any thing to us. To mortifie ſinne it is a part of Chriſts kingly power, of his kingly office. Now hee that chalengeth any vertue, and power to mortifie ſinne in himſelfe, or to raiſe himſelfe to a new life of grace, hee is guilty of high treaſon, hee uſurpes on the Kings prerogative. It is Chriſts prerogative onely to mortifie ſinne in us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if it come of Chriſt alone, our death to ſinne and our life of grace; then wee ſee what to judge of them that are out of Chriſt, ſinne is neyther mortified in them, nor they quickned to a new life of grace. If all water proceede from one Fountaine, then that that is ſeperate from that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine muſt of neceſſitie be dry. If Chriſt be the Fountaine of all Grace, by which our ſinnes are mortified, and wee quickned to a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108344:57"/> new life, then they that are out of Chriſt, they cannot have eyther death to ſinne, or the life of grace: Whatſoever is in them it is dead, if there bee any thing that is good, whatſoever it is it is dead, whatſoever is alive in them it is but dead, it makes them dead to grace here, and aſſures them that except they be revived, they ſhall goe from one death to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, from ſpirituall death to eternall, for evermore.</p>

            <p>The Chapter conteines a deſcription of Chriſt, of his comming into, and his harſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement in the world, his ſufferings and reſurrection, ſo fully and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that at the firſt view a man would think it were rather a Hiſtory than a Propheſie, and rather a relation of ſome what paſt, then a prediction of any thing to come. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for the better diſtinct underſtanding of the method, and coherence of the words, know that <hi>Iſay,</hi> (the Eagle-eyed Prophet, as one calls him) having in the ſecond verſe of this Chapter ſhewed how meane and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in the eyes of men, Chriſts incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be. In the fourth verſe hee ſhewes what the judgement, and cenſure of the world ſhould bee concerning Chriſt, how baſely and indignly they ſhould conceive of him; not as hee was indeede the innocent, &amp; immaculate Lambe of God, but as a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious malefactor, one that for his owne ſins was ſtricken of God, and humbled. But how unjuſt and impious their opinion was, the Prophet ſhewes in Verſ. 5. whereof my Text is a part.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by remooving the falſe cauſe of his ſuffering which was ſuppoſed to be his owne ſinne in this particle <hi>But: We judged him to be ſtricken and afflicted of God, But:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, there was no ſuch thing. He firſt remooves the falſe cauſe of his ſuffering,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108344:59"/> which was his owne ſinne, we judged it to be his owne ſinne, and deſerving; <hi>But.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, by aſſigning the true cauſe in theſe words, <hi>Hee was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> not for any ſinne of his owne, but for our tranſgreſſions, you ſee the coherence of the words, and the context.

            <p>Gold-ſmiths, weigh their gold to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt weight, and the priviledges of Scripture are ſuch, that there is not a word or tittle, but it is as ful of weight, as it is certaine of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment. This <hi>But</hi> is like a counterblaſt of a contrary wind that meetes a Ship in her full ſayle, and turnes her courſe another way. Thus it runnes, <hi>Wee judged him ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God,</hi> as deſerving it by his owne ſins, <hi>But.</hi> It checks and controlls the hard conceit that the world entertained of Chriſt, who looked on him in the falſe glaſſe of envie, and tooke him, or miſtooke him to bee a <hi>Wine bibber, a Glutton,</hi> a Blaſphemer, and what you will, ſaving what they ſhould; and ſo that hee ſuffered death for his owne ſinnes and tranſgreſſions. This <hi>But</hi> checks, and controlls the conceit that the world had of Chriſt. Which being ſo; The deduction hence in a word is, that
<q>What Chriſt ſuffered on earth, either torments of body, or anguiſh of ſoule, it was not for any ſinne, or fault of his owne that hee was guiltie of perſonally.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:108344:60"/>
            <p>Wee looking to outward appearance, wee judged him ſmitten of God, and afflicted: but this <hi>But,</hi> hath the force of a negation: there was no ſuch thing. I ſay, whatſoever Chriſt ſuffered on earth, whether torment of body, or anguiſh of ſoule, it was not for any ſinne of his owne.</p>
            <p>This the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered once for ſinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>The juſt, for the unjuſt, that hee might bring us to God.</hi> Where the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> having ſaid, that Chriſt ſuffered for ſinne, leſt ſome ſhould miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Chriſt ſuffered for his owne ſinne; hee prevents this cavill, and removes the ground of ſuſpition, <hi>The juſt for the unjuſt.</hi> If Chriſt had ſuffered for his owne ſinnes, hee had not ſuffered as juſt, but as unjuſt, as a malefactour, hee had ſuffered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to his owne tranſgreſſions: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.20, 21, 22.</note> Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe to whom hee wrote, to patient ſuffering, and induring of injuries, though undeſerved, hee ſets before them the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of Chriſt, who though hee had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no evil, and <hi>there was no guile found in his mouth, yet when he was reviled, reviled not againe; when hee ſuffered, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee reproached not, but committed himſelfe to God that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> Marke, though hee had committed no evill, nor
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108344:61"/> there was no guile found in his mouth, there was no ſinne, or demerite of his owne, that he ſhould deſerve ſuch puniſhments.</p>
            <p>And this is one difference that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle obſerves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. betweene the high Prieſts under the Law, and our high Prieſt Chriſt: they offered, firſt for their owne ſinnes, and then for the ſinnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but Chriſt had no need to offer ſacrifice for his owne ſinnes, for he had none: but we have ſuch a high Prieſt, and ſuch a one it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came us to have, <hi>as is holy, and undefiled, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from ſinners;</hi> And this is the reaſon likewiſe, why the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, aſſigning the true reaſon of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, hee repeats, and inculcates theſe, and the like phraſes; <hi>Hee bore our infirmities, and carried our ſorrowes, hee was broken for our iniquities, and wounded for our tranſgreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with his ſtripes wee are healed.</hi> Still hee layes all the fault, and blame upon our ſelves: but hee doth not ſo much as mention any fault in himſelfe, whereby hee did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to die.</p>
            <p>And indeed, how could hee ſuffer for his owne ſinne, that was free from all ſinne? So ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Hee was made ſinne for us, that knew no ſinne: Hee knew no ſinne;</hi> that is, hee did practiſe none, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted none: for in ſpirituall things wee are ſaid, to know no more good then wee pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108344:61"/> ſo Chriſt is ſaid to know no evill; that is, hee practiſed it not. Hee <hi>made him ſinne for us, that knew no ſinne,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee was free from originall ſinne in his birth and conception.</p>
            <p>And hee was free from actuall ſinnes in his life and converſation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, hee was free from Originall ſinne in his birth and conception: For whereas there are two parts of originall ſinne.</p>
            <p>Firſt the imputation of the guilt of that actuall ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> in eating the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the corruption or perverſneſſe, derived, and propagated to us from our firſt Parents: Chriſt was free from both.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Hee was free from the guilt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſinne: though hee had his nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> hee was a child of <hi>Adam,</hi> but hee was not begotten by <hi>Adam,</hi> not by a ſonne of man; the latter whereof is that that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titleth us to our firſt Parents tranſgreſſion, and makes it ours. <hi>By one man ſinne entred into the world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for that corruption, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſſe that followed on that tranſgreſſion of the command of God, Chriſt was free from this, not by vertue of the Wombe that bare him, as if the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had beene free from ſinne, as <hi>Scotus</hi> affirmes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Third ſentence, <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 26. <hi>Article</hi> 4.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108344:62"/> but hee was free from ſinne by the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall worke of the holy Ghoſt, ſanctifying and purging that ſubſtance of the Virgin, whereof his body was framed, from the common infection of our nature: ſo that he is ſtyled by the Angell,<note place="margin">Luke 1.75.</note> 
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75. <hi>That holy thing,</hi> by way of excellencie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as Chriſt was free from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſo from actuall ſinne: as hee was free from Originall ſinne, in his birth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, ſo he was free from actuall ſinne in his life and converſation, ſo in the ninth verſe of this chapter, <hi>Hee had done no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; there was no deceit in his mouth; hee committed no evill,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes. On this ground Chriſt challengeth the <hi>Iewes, Which of you can accuſe mee of evill?</hi> It is true, they accuſed him, and laid many crimes to his charge; (as what innocent was ever ſo happy, as to be exempted, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged from unjuſt imputations?) but how flight they were, you may judge by this in that the Iudge, before whom he ſtood as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the barre, accounted him acquitted, though hee uſed no oratory but ſilence; <hi>I find no ſinne in this man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Chriſt had had any ſinne of his owne, hee could not have ſatisfied God for us, hee might have quit ſcores with God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but for our hand-writing it had ſtood ſtill. Let this ſuffice to ſhew that what Chriſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108344:62"/> ſuffred on earth in body or ſoule, it was not for any ſinne of his owne, but for us; not that hee ſtood perſonally guiltie.</p>
            <p>But how then could it ſtand with the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God to ſuffer him to die,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
               </label> if hee did not deſerve death:<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.20.</note> for ſo wee find in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20. ſo runnes the menace, if Chriſt did not ſinne, how could God ſuffer him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the puniſhment due to ſinne?</p>
            <p>I anſwer briefly, Chriſt is to bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a double reſpect; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> either as a private perſon, or as a publike perſon ſtanding in our roome, and ſtead.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt bee conſidered as a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo, it is true, it could not ſtand with the juſtice of God to ſuffer him to die; becauſe hee was not guiltie of inherent, perſonall ſinne: <hi>and ſhall not the Iudge of all the world doe right?</hi> But conſider Chriſt as a publike perſon ſtanding in our roome and ſtead, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on him the guilt, and burden of our tranſgreſſions, ſo the juſtice of God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that hee ſhould die: becauſe though hee were not guiltie of any perſonall ſinne: yet hee was ſo guiltie, as our ſinnes were tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and imputed to him, and ſo it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite hee ſhould die. Looke as it is among men, it is no injuſtice that a man ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a debt of him that hath undertaken to pay it for another, eſpecially if hee bee able and willing to pay. So God was juſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108344:63"/> the debt of obedience and ſuffering, hee having undertaken it, and being both able, and willing to pay.<note place="margin">Joh. 10.18.</note> Hee was willing, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>I lay downe my life, there is no man that takes it from mee.</hi> Hee layed it downe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced. Secondly, Chriſt was able to pay the debt, hee was able by dying to ſatisfie the juſtice of God to the utmoſt, to drinke the cuppe of Gods wrath to the dregges for us, and to free us by death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Hee is able to ſave them that come to him to the very utmoſt.</hi> Nay, he not only freed us, but himſelfe too, from being held captive under the power, and dominion of death. Let this ſuffice for the firſt Uſe, for inſtruction, that if Chriſt had no ſinne of his owne, how it could ſtand with the juſtice of God, that he ſhould beare the puniſhment due to ſinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſerves to diſcover the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame malice of the <hi>Iewes</hi> againſt Chriſt, eſpecially the Scribes and Phariſees, whoſe heads as they were buſieſt in plotting, ſo their hands were deepeſt imbrued in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of Chriſts death: notwithſtanding ſuch was his innocencie, avouched to their faces, by him that betrayed him, <hi>Iudas; I have betrayed the innocent bloud;</hi> and by him that condemned him, <hi>Pilate; I find no fault in this man.</hi> Yet ſuch was their malice, they laid the greateſt things againſt him, that the wit of man could deviſe, or impudencie
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108344:63"/> object: and yet they were not ſatisfied with this, till as Wolves of the evening they had torne the Lambe of God without ſorrow, or compaſſion. The blood of a meane man unjuſtly ſpilt is a crying ſinne, a skarlet ſinne, of a deepe crimſon dye; every wound is a mouth and every drop a tongue to cry, as the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> for vengeance on the murtherer: but the death of Chriſt, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of Chriſt, it was a ſinne of ſo high a ſtraine, that for this ſinne God hath ſpent his plagues, hee hath emptied the quiver of his judgements on that nation, and made them ever ſince a reproach to the world, a hiſſing and gaſing ſtocke, and an aſtoniſhment to men and Angels.</p>
            <p>If any enquire the way how it muſt be that the crucifying of Chriſt ſhould bee ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous a ſinne in the Iewes,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
               </label> when that which they did was no other then that which God in his determinate counſell had fore-ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Him have yee with wicked hands taken and crucified,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2.23.</note> 
               <hi>being delivered by the determinate counſell, and foreknowledge of God:</hi> How then could it be ſo hainous a ſinne in the Iewes to crucifie Chriſt, ſeeing what they did was according to the determinate counſell of God?</p>
            <p>I anſwer briefly thus:<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> It is true indeede they did no other then God had ordained to be done, but yet it was little thankes to them,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108344:64"/> who leaſt intended it; they did performe Gods purpoſe, but all this while they had little thought and purpoſe in them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.<note place="margin">Iſay 10.5.6.</note> See the like, <hi>Iſay</hi> 10.5.6. <hi>Oh Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>the rod of mine anger, and the ſtaffe in their hand is mine indignation. I will ſend him againſt an hipocriticall nation, and againſt the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the ſpoyle and the prey, and to tread them downe like the mire in the ſtreets. Howbeit, hee meaneth not ſo, neyther doth his heart thinke ſo.</hi> What then doth he thinke? <hi>Surely I will cut off, and deſtroy nations not a few.</hi> See what the Lord ſaith in Verſ. 12. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith the Lord by the mouth of the Prophet) <hi>when I have performed my whole worke upon Mount Sion and Ieruſalem, I will puniſh the fruite of the proud heart of the King of Aſsiria.</hi> Obſerve, the King of <hi>Aſsiria</hi> was Gods inſtrument, his officer and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner to inflict that puniſhment that the Iewes had deſerved, and it was Gods will and decree: notwithſtanding, becauſe though hee did that that God had purpoſed to bee done, yet hee had not a purpoſe to doe it: becauſe that that he did, was not out of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods will, it was not for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God but out of a proud humour: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God had ſcourged them, God would puniſh him; and when his people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had felt the rod, hee would caſt the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108344:64"/> rod into the fire of his indignation.</p>
            <p>So then to apply it, looke as it ſtood with the King of <hi>Aſsiria</hi> in puniſhing the Iewes, ſo it was with the Iewes in their crucifying of Chriſt. It is true what <hi>Caiphas</hi> unawares propheſied, <hi>that it was expedient that one man ſhould die, and give his life for the people;</hi> yet the Iewes intended it not when they put him to death, but did it out of malice,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.28.</note> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.28. and that with God (that eyes not ſo much the worke and action of the hand, as the intent and affection of the doer, I ſay, with God) they were eſteemed no better than cruell murderers and butchers of Chriſt: So Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſtickes not to tell them to their face, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23.<note place="margin">Act. 2.23.</note> 
               <hi>Your wicked hands have crucified him, that God in his determinate counſell delivered;</hi> ſtill he calls them wicked hands though they did that which was Gods determinate counſell.</p>
            <p>It is not ſufficient to make an action good and warrantable, that it bee conformable to Gods ſecret will, in the thing willed except there be a conformitie in the manner of our willing. For a man, while the will of God is hid may doe that that God wills not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; our rule being the revealed will, as the Gloſſe hath it. As a man that hath a Father, or a Friend ſicke, his friend knowes not whether hee ſhall recover, though God have determined that the man ſhall dye, yet
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108344:65"/> hee may pray for his recovery, he wills a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe thing from that of God, and yet it is warantable: A man may doe that which is Gods ſecret will and yet be faultie if hee doe not doe it in that manner that God wills. Let this ſuffice to bee ſpoken of the ſecond Uſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as it ſerves for the juſt condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Iewes, and ſuch as unjuſtly condemned Chriſt, ſo in the next place it ſeemes to remoove the groſſe carnall conceit in the vaine hearts of men, in our dayes; men that make the ſquare and rule of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſucceſſe in outward things; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce of men, of their innocencie, or guilt, of their favour, or disfavour with God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their proſperitie or adverſitie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſucceſſe of things below. A thing that falls foule upon the Papiſts, that make outward proſperitie an inſeparable note of the Church. Thus it was with the friends of <hi>Iob, miſerable comforters,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe juſtly ſtiles them; they ſaw him afflicted in his goods, in his children, in his perſon, and from theſe premiſes they concluded preſently that he was an hypocrite. Thus it was with the barbarous people,<note place="margin">Act. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Act.</hi> 23. when they ſaw a Viper faſtned upon Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, preſently the Viper ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited him a murtherer. Nay Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples did ſo,<note place="margin">Joh. 9.29.</note> 
               <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.29. no ſooner did they ſee
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108344:65"/> a man that was borne blind, but they they queſtioned with our Saviour, <hi>Who ſinned, this man or his parents that he was borne blind?</hi> implying that it muſt needs bee that this man muſt ſinne himſelfe blinde. So it was with the Iewes in this Chapter Verſ. 3. they ſaw Chriſt <hi>deſpiſed and rejected of men,</hi> and preſently they inferre, that he was rejected of God, ſmitten of God, and humbled for his owne ſinnes; but ſuch men muſt thinke that even Chriſt himſelfe who like <hi>Abſalom,</hi> from the crowne of his head to the ſole of his foote, had no ſtayne or blemiſh of ſinne in him, yet hee taſted as deepe of the cup of Gods wrath, and more than any mortal man; beſides, he that ſtood higheſt in his Fathers favour was moſt low and deſpicable in the eyes of the world, he that was the favourite of his Father <hi>in whom his Father was well pleaſed,</hi> yet hee was not exempt from that ſcourge <hi>wherewith God chaſteneth every Sonne that he receiveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, if Chriſt ſuffered not for his owne ſinnes; This reades us a Lecture of patience, to put up injuries, though they bee not deſerved in the world. It is the plea of ſome men when they are injured, it would not trouble me if I deſerved it; thinke what Chriſt deſerved at the hands of the Iewes what hee had done that hee was ſo uſed. In 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 21. <hi>Chriſt dyed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 4.21.</note> 
               <hi>and hath left us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108344:66"/> to follow his ſteps.</hi> What example, but an example of patience that we ſhould follow him when wee ſuffer undeſerving? <hi>Seneca</hi> gives that adviſe in his 69. Epiſtle, as if hee had beene a Diſciple of Chriſt.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.21.</note> We ſhould labour to imitate Chriſt in this, in putting up and digeſting injuries, though on our part they be cauſe leſſe and undeſerved. In 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>What glory is it, if when yee be buffeted for your faults yee take it patiently?</hi> what great matter is it? <hi>but if when you doe well and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it then you beare it patiently, this is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</hi> It is true, it is acceptable to God, that wee ſuffer puniſhment patiently when wee have deſerved it; but when wee are patient and have not deſerved it, it is highly acceptable, as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, and laſtly, Chriſt dyed not for his owne ſinnes, then here is Balme in <hi>Gilead,</hi> comfort for wounded and diſtreſſed, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that faint under the weight and burden of their ſinnes. It is true indeede if Chriſt had dyed for his owne ſinnes, then our eſtate had beene woefull and lamentable, then hee had quit ſcores only with God for himſelfe, but we ſhould ſtill have remayned as deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged as ever, and have beene caſt into utter darkeneſſe, and have beene reſerved in chaynes till we had payd the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but now Chriſt hath ſuffered for us.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108344:66"/> Then as the Apoſtle inferres,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.34.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Who ſhall condemne? Let Sathan</hi> the accuſer of the brethren bring what objections hee will, this one plea will anſwer all; <hi>Chriſt dyed,</hi> if he dyed, then he hath appeaſed the wrath of God to us, and payd the debt of the Law, and the puniſhment of the Law, and fulfilled obedience, and given ſatisfaction to God. Chriſt had no ſinne of his owne, therefore what hee ſuffered, it was for our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions. This ſhall ſuffice to bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the negative part from this particular, <hi>But,</hi> that carries the force of a negation. That Chriſt was affirmed to ſuffer for his owne ſinne, <hi>We judged him ſmitten of God and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: But.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The affirmative part followes to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>But He was wounded for our tranſgreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where I ſhall not neede to tell you, that by being wounded in this place, wee are not to underſtand onely, nor principally (as ſome Popiſh writers doe) the bodily torments, and tortures of Chriſt that hee as this day indured on the Croſſe; but withall, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe ſecret agonies and conflicts of ſoule that he felt, that were cauſed out of a deeper apprehenſion of the greatneſſe of our ſinnes that hee ſuffered for, and the ſenſe of the greatneſſe of Gods wrath that hee then ſuſtained; which being ſo, the concluſion
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108344:67"/> from this affirmitive part is this, that
<q>
                  <p>Chriſt Ieſus ſuffered extreame torments in his body, and ſad and amazing agonies in his ſoule, for our ſinnes and trangreſsions.</p>
                  <p>He was wounded for our tranſgreſsions, &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For the proofe of it I neede not range far from the Text. In the fourth verſe of this Chapter, ſurely ſaith the Prophet, <hi>hee hath borne our griefes and ſorrowes.</hi> In the fifth verſ. <hi>hee was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was on him, by his ſtripes wee are healed,</hi> In the ſixth verſ. <hi>The Lord hath layd upon him the iniquitie of us all.</hi> In the eighth verſ. <hi>For the tranſgreſsion of my people was he ſtricken.</hi> In verſ. 10. <hi>He made his ſoule an offering for ſinne.</hi> In the 12. verſ. <hi>he pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out his ſoule to death.</hi> Wee ſee, he was broken for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was on him: and this not onely in body but in ſoule too, <hi>he poured out his ſoule to death, he made his ſoule an offering for ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you aske the reaſon why,</p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt, It is a rule of the Schooles where the gift is free and undeſerved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out merit or deſert on our part, there the beſt if not the onely reaſon that can bee aſſigned of that gift, is the free grace and love of the doner. So this gift is freely from Chriſts
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108344:67"/> love to us: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2.<note place="margin">Eph. 5.2.</note> 
               <hi>Let us love one another, as Chriſt hath loved us, and given himſelfe a ranſome for us;</hi> where hee ſhewes not only the manner how wee ſhould love one another, <hi>As Chriſt hath loved us;</hi> but the motive how he loved us, hee ſuffered for us, he loved us, and gave himſelfe a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as it was the love of Chriſt to give himſelfe, ſo it was the love of God that gave Chriſt: as Chriſt ſaith it of himſelfe, ſo hee ſpeakes it likewiſe of his Father,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that hee gave his only begotten Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> Wee muſt not thinke that God then begins to love us, when God is actually reconciled to us in his Sonne: (ſo ſome conceive but amiſſe, if I be not deceived, and miſtaken) for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.18.</note> 
               <hi>Hee loved us when wee were enemies.</hi> God loves us not only when wee are friends, when wee are actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by the death of his Sonne; but when wee were enemies.<note place="margin">S. Aug. pſal. <hi>113.</hi>
               </note> So ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>God loves us when hee hates us, hee loves us as creatures, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hee hates us as ſinners:</hi> So I ſay, God doth not then begin to love us, when wee are actually reconciled by the death of his Sonne, but hee firſt loved us, and becauſe hee loved us, therefore hee gave his Sonne,<note place="margin">Pet. Mart.</note> (As <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaith excellently) as the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108344:68"/> pledge and pawne, and earneſt of his love. So then that is the ſecond reaſon, that as Chriſt gave himſelfe out of love, ſo God gave Chriſt becauſe he loved us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as the love of God was the cauſe of this, ſo the juſtice of God required that Chriſt ſhould die: For God had no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to redeeme man; and man being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſatisfie Gods juſtice for his ſinne, it was needfull that Chriſt as our ſuretie ſhould anſwer that, that wee were not able to doe, and to take our burden.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> And here when wee conſider the infinite wiſedome of God, deviſing ſo to fit a means for the reconciling the mercy and juſtice of God in our ſalvation, and redemption, wee have cauſe to crie out with the Apoſtle, <hi>Oh the deepneſſe and riches of the knowledge and wiſedome of God, how unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out.</hi> It is true, I denie not the print, and footſteppes of the wayes of God in the Creation, the Heathens themſelves diſcovered, by the darke and dimme light of reaſon; The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then could diſcerne it in the Creation: but for the print of his footſteps in Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, men and Angels could not conceive, how infinite juſtice, and infinite mercy ſhould come together: how ſinners ſhould die eternally, and bee ſaved eternally, and live for ever: How God ſhould be juſt, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108344:68"/> yet man that had ſinned not die; theſe wayes are paſt finding out. But now in the death of Chriſt, all theſe ſeeming contradictions are eaſily reconciled. For now as in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſing of <hi>Davids</hi> Ditty, <hi>Mercy and Iuſtice are met together, truth and mercie kiſſe each other.</hi> For firſt, that God ſhould puniſh ſinne at all, it was an act of Gods juſtice: but that God ſhould puniſh ſinne, not in our ſelves, but in Chriſt it was an act of mercy. That God ſhould exact the payment of the debt to the utmoſt far thing, it was an act of ſevere ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: but that hee did not exact it at our hands our ſelves, but at the hands of our Suretie, this was mercy, infinite mercy. So that wee have great cauſe to ſay, and ſo wee may well with <hi>David,</hi> wee may ſay on this occaſion of Redemption, as hee on the Creation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.</note> 
               <hi>How admirable are thy workes! In wondrous wiſedome thou haſt made them all.</hi> That for the firſt uſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as it ſerves to ſet up the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous greatneſſe of Gods wiſedome; ſo likewiſe it ſerves to ſet forth the grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and haynouſneſſe of our ſinnes. It is a true ſaying; No glaſſe can repreſent ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the grievouſneſſe of our ſinnes, not the torments of the damned in Hell, as the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt on the Croſſe for ſin. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe ſinnes muſt needes bee great, that could not bee expiated, but at ſo deare a rate
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108344:69"/> as the ſhedding of the bloud of Chriſt. I come not to diſpute here, as the Schooles, nicely and curiouſly, and unprofitably, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God could have deviſed another means to worke the redemption of man kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the death of his Sonne.</p>
            <p>I know, it is not for man to confine the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and to ſay, this God can doe: as he ſaith to the Sea, <hi>Hither ſhalt thou goe, and here thou ſhalt ſtay, thy proud waves ſhall goe no further.</hi> It is not for man to ſay ſo to Gods wiſedome and power, this God can doe, and hee can doe no more. But let me tell you thus much, that the Sonne of God was more precious, and deare in the eyes of his Father, then to ſuffer him to die a curſed death, if the worke of redemption, could bee ſo well, and ſo conveniently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed otherwiſe. I cannot thinke but that the Sonne of God was more precious in the eyes of his Father, then to ſuffer him to undergo ſuch a curſed Ignominious death, if redemption could have beene effected by other meanes. Nay, I ſpeake more boldly (for I may doe it upon good ground) the ſatisfaction for mans ſinne, it was ſuch a worke, as could not have beene performed, but by the finger of God: Men, nor Angels could not doe it; they might have given ſome ſatisfaction, but they could not give a valuable ſatisfaction.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.6.</note> As it is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:108344:69"/> 
               <hi>Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome for all;</hi> that is not all, he gave himſelfe not only a ranſome, but a full, valuable, ſufficient ranſome. I ſay, all men and Angels could not have given to God a ſufficient ranſome.</p>
            <p>Firſt, not men; becauſe no man can pay his owne ſcore, therefore hee cannot ſatisfie for others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, not Angels, being finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted natures, they could not undergoe the puniſhment of our ſinnes which was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: there was an infinite puniſhment due to our ſinnes, becauſe we had offended infinite juſtice; and there is no creature can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe an infinite puniſhment. Nay, I ſay more, all the Angels, and Arch-angells in Heaven, if they had united their forces, to ſuſtaine and indure one moment, thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding unexpreſſible agonies that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured on the Croſſe, when hee ſaid, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> they would have broken them, and have cruſhed them downe irrecoverably to Hell. Then farr bee it from us to ſet light by thoſe ſinnes, the weight and burden whereof, none but Chriſt could undergoe, and when hee did undergoe them, it made him bow and buckle, and by his owne confeſſion it made his ſoule <hi>heavy to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, as it ſerves to diſcover the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes; ſo it ſerves to provoke
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108344:70"/> us to ſorrow, and humiliation for our ſinnes: for what; did Chriſt ſhed droppes of bloud for our ſinnes, and ſhall not wee ſhed teares for them? Thus it was with the converts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2 37.<note place="margin">Act. 2.37.</note> when <hi>Peter</hi> told them <hi>your wicked hands have crucified Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>they were pricked in their hearts;</hi> Nay, that is not all, they were pricked <hi>through</hi> in their hearts, or violently: as it were, all the floud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of ſorrow were opened; they were pricked thorow with ſorrow. And miſtake mee not Brethren; thinke not that it was the ſouldiers, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> only that crucified Chriſt: no, it was every one of us, our hands are as deeply imbrewed in the bloud of Chriſt as theirs. Our wicked thoughts are as thornes that goared his precious head. Our wicked actions are as nayles that faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his hands and feete to the tree. Our oathes and blaſphemies are as ſwords and ſpeares, that pierced his ſacred ſide. Oh then can wee chooſe but bee pricked in our hearts, when wee have crucified Chriſt! If <hi>Peter</hi> went out and wept bitterly when hee had denied Chriſt, what cauſe have wee to weepe, teares, not of brine, but of bloud, when wee looke upon Chriſt whom we have ſo cruelly crucified! How can that chooſe but bee ſorrow, and compunction to us, that occaſioned ſo much anguiſh and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Chriſt! <hi>Oh that our heads were
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108344:70"/> rivers, and our eyes fountaines of teares, that wee might weepe day and night for our ſinnes and tranſgreſsions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, as it ſerves to humble us, ſo it ſerves for comfort and conſolation, as I told you; for what ſaith the Apoſtle? <hi>Chriſt died, who ſhall condemne?</hi> Chriſt died: then hee hath appeaſed his Fathers wrath, then hee hath ſatisfied his Fathers juſtice, then hee hath redeemed us from Hell, hee hath made Heaven ſmile on us, hee hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a crowne of glory, hee hath tryumphed over, and trampled under our ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Let mee ſing with <hi>Iſay, Iſay</hi> 44.23.<note place="margin">Iſay 44.23.</note> 
               <hi>Sing oh heavens, and ſhout yee lower parts of the earth,</hi> Why? <hi>The Lord hath redeemed Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and glorified himſelfe in Iſraell.</hi> And ſurely brethren, whatſoever wee thinke now in our ſtrength and bravery, and jollitie, there is nothing in the world will miniſter comfort but this in time of diſtreſſe, when wee ſhall come either upon the racke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or come to the ſight, and kenne of death, or to appeare before that Tribunall: there is nothing but the death of Chriſt will ſtead us. What elſe in the world will revive, and cheare a drouping ſoule affrighted with horrour, groaning, and bowed under the burden of ſinne? What will bee able to ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a mans heart, and conſcience, that fears the approach of death, but this? What elſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108344:71"/> will make him ſtand upright and unapaled before Gods Tribunall at that terrible day? In all theſe ſad exigents, in theſe times, the bloud of Chriſt it ſerves as <hi>Rahabs</hi> ſcarlet threed, it is a token to us that God will deale mercifully with us. Only, it muſt bee our care, as it was the Spies condition with <hi>Rahab,</hi> to tie it in the Window, wee muſt looke to tye it to our ſelves by faith, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie it to our ſelves, and then you ſhall never miſcarry.</p>
            <p>Againe, as it ſerves for comfort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation: ſo it ſerves as a rich Mirrour to ſet forth the love of God to us. If the <hi>Iewes</hi> could conclude from our Saviours ſhedding of a few teares over <hi>Lazarus, Ioh.</hi> 11.36. they ſee him ſhed a few teares over dead <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 11.36.</note> 
               <hi>ſee how hee loved him,</hi> ſay they: With how much more force may wee conclude, ſince Chriſt hath ſhed his bloud, ſee how he loved us? <hi>Greater love then this</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>hath no man, then to lay downe his life for his friend.</hi> It is true, bleſſed Saviour greater love hath no man: but thou art more then Man, and thou haſt done more then this, for thou haſt laid downe thy life for thine enemies.</p>
            <p>It was the honour of that <hi>Trajan</hi> when a Souldier was wounded, he ſuffered his owne clothes to be rent, and made clouts to bind up his wounds: but what is this to the love
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108344:71"/> of Chriſt, that not only did forgoe his cloathes, but was content that his owne fleſh ſhould be torne for us to cover our wounds, this he did. Obſerve, this love was ſhewed to us, not to Angels, creatures more noble, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.<note place="margin">Heb. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>By no meanes tooke hee the nature of Angels.</hi> As hee did not take their nature, ſo hee did not ſuffer their puniſhment due to their tranſgreſſion and Apoſtacie: when thoſe ſonnes of the morning fell from their prime eſtate, they fell as the Elephant, they could not raiſe themſelves, and they are ſtill reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe, and ſhall to the laſt day: but when man ſinned, God ſent his Sonne to ſuffer death on the Croſſe for us; wee have reaſon to ſay as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Lord what is man, that thou art ſo mindfull of him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, if ſuch, and ſo great hath beene the love of Chriſt to us, then what can wee doe leſſe, then to returne like love backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to him? Wee know a Diamond is beſt faſhioned by a Diamond; love is the beſt procurer and ſolicitour of love, how can we but love God, that hath ſent his Sonne to die for us! How can wee eſteeme any thing too deare for him, that eſteemed nothing too deare for us! And if Chriſt did give his life for us, ſhall wee grudge to give a penney, to part with ſomewhat for his members? How ſhall wee eſteeme any thing too deare
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108344:72"/> for him? ſhall we not part with our luſts for him? Surely, if there be any argument in the world will prevaile, it is this argument from Chriſts love, that will perſwade men to obedience: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> that apprehended it,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us;</hi> it conſtraineth us to doe that that God requires. Let us take heed that wee doe not trample under foot the precious bloud of Chriſt, by committing thoſe ſinnes it was ſhed for.<note place="margin">Exod. 12.6.</note> In <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.6. we ſhall find that the bloud of the Paſſeover was ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled on the two ſide-poſts, and the upper doore poſt, but not upon the threſhold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-foot, implying, and intimating in what high reverence and eſteeme wee ſhould have the bloud of Chriſt, we ſhould not trample on it. The bloud of the Paſſeover was ſprinkled on the two ſide-poſts, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per poſt of the houſe, but not on the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, underfoot. If ſuch reverence were due to that that was but the type, how much is due to that that is the ſubſtance? Then let us take heed wee trample not under-foot the bloud of Chriſt, by wilfull committing thoſe ſinnes for which it was ſhed. Let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; nay, let it bee too much that wee have once crucified Chriſt, let us doe ſo no more; if wee doe ſo, wee are worſe then the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Every wilfull ſinne we commit, we crucifie Chriſt, and hee that crucifieth Chriſt now,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108344:72"/> is worſe then the <hi>Iewes:</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> crucified him in the time of his humiliation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement, but now if wee doe it, it is in his exaltation, when hee ſits at the right hand of God. Let us all take up that ſpeech, <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> 9.14. <hi>Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 9.14.</note> 
               <hi>ſince thou haſt ſtayed us from being beneath for our iniquities, ſhould wee breake thy Commandements? wouldeſt not thou returne, and confound us?</hi> Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are as ſtrong phyſicke, if it worke not health, it makes more ſicke. Every bleſſing, eſpecially ſuch as this, makes us either better or worſe, certainly that heart is ſteele, or braſſe, which the ſence of the love of God cannot move to leave evill and vile courſes. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Verſes going before, from the 25.<note place="margin">Coherence.</note> to the 34. of this Chapter, our bleſſed Saviour had diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the hearing of his Diſciples, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and concerning the ſignes and tokens that ſhould foregoe that day; by occaſion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108344:74"/> of a queſtion he had propoſed to him at the ſeventh Verſe, concerning the deſtruction, and demolition of the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> when that ſhould be, <hi>And his Diſciples asked him ſaying, Maſter, when ſhall theſe things be? and what ſhall be the ſignes when they ſhall come to paſſe?</hi> When this is done, from the 34. verſ. to the 37. our bleſſed Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to make uſe of this: from the former premiſes to draw ſome concluſions, and thoſe are,</p>
            <p>Partly by way of
<list>
                  <item>admonition</item>
                  <item>exhortation</item>
               </list> to his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>By way of admonition in verſ. 34. that ſince it is certaine that ſuch a day, the day of judgement will come, (but when it will come nothing more uncertaine) when God will examine and ſift the lives of every man, and paſſe an unpartiall ſentence upon all the acts and deeds of their lives in this world, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them therefore <hi>to take heede leaſt at any time their hearts ſhould bee overcharged with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life,</hi> which Chriſt enforceth by the danger that otherwiſe might befall them, <hi>and ſo that day come upon them unawares,</hi> which he further enforceth in the verſe following: <hi>for as a ſnare ſhall it come on all them that dwell on the earth,</hi> that is the firſt thing by way of admonition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by way of exhortation in the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108344:74"/> 35. and 36. verſes, that ſince it is certaine ſuch a day ſhall come, and uncertaine when, therefore they ſhould watch and pray, and not a while onely, but continually and conſtantly that ſo they might bee accounted worthy to eſcape the evill that ſhould come upon the world, and at the comming of the Sonne of God they might ſtand undaunted, and unapaled before him.</p>
            <p>The words I have read, are a part of the former, of the admonition. <hi>Take heede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to your ſelves leaſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeiting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares.</hi> In which words ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with me theſe five parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you have the caution it ſelfe, <hi>Take heede.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prats of the Text.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, you have the perſons to whom the caution is given. <hi>To your ſelves.</hi> It was to the Diſciples of Chriſt to whom this was given in charge immediatly, but in them to us all, as appeares by a paralell anſwerable place, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. <hi>What I ſay to you I ſay to all, Watch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the time, how long they muſt take heede, <hi>leaſt at any time.</hi> Their care and caution muſt be conſtant and continuall.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, of what they muſt take heede, and that is, firſt in a generall, <hi>leaſt your hearts be over preſſed, or overcharged or burthened.</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:108344:75"/> And then more particularly, leaſt they bee overcharged <hi>with ſurfeiting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the cares of this life,</hi> for with theſe three, the hearts of men are ordinarily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and laſtly, the reaſon why they ſhould uſe this caution, or the motive infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this caution, <hi>leaſt that day come upon you unawares.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>And take heede to your ſelves leaſt, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>I begin with the firſt part, the caution it ſelfe, in the firſt word.</p>
            <q>Take heede.</q>
            <p>Be well adviſed, uſe all care, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, intend your thoughts, for ſo the word implies, <hi>proſequeti,</hi> to apply their mindes, and intend their thoughts. Now what Chriſt gave in charge to his Diſciples, though hee gave it firſt and primarily to them, yet not to them alone, but to us, in and from them: So the concluſion is this, that,</p>

               <note place="margin">Surfeiting, drunkenneſſe and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be taken heed of.</note>It is, and ought to be the care of every one, as to take heed of all other ſinnes, ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, leaſt ther hearts bee overcharged with meate and drinke, and the cares of this life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take heede</hi> ſaith our Saviour. He ſaith not onely forbeare, but wee muſt watch and be cautionate, that our hearts be not over char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. I ſay it ought to bee the care of every
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108344:75"/> one, as to take heede of all ſinnes in generall, ſo eſpecially that their hearts be not overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>with ſurfeiting, drunkennes, and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that their hearts bee not overcharged with meat and drink, and the cares of this life.</p>
            <p>Hence it was that that the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iude</hi> in the 12. verſe of his Epiſtle, ſpeaking of thoſe ſeducers that crept into the Church for this end, to ſolicite thoſe that had given their names to Chriſt, to defection and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie: among other vices and faults he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them with this one, <hi>they feede themſelves without feare,</hi> what is the meaning of that? <hi>feeding themſelves without feare?</hi> that is, they gave free ſcope, they let looſe the reines of their ſenſuall appetite, they gorged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, without feare or care what iſſue it would bring in the conſequent. Now if it were the fault of thoſe ſeducers to feede themſelves without feare: then it is the dutie of us, to feed our ſelves with feare, and to uſe care and caution in feeding our ſelves, that wee bee not overcharged with ſurfeiting. That is for the firſt part. So <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20. hee unfolds two of them in one verſe; hee gives a charge to be carefull, and cautionate, ſaith he, <hi>Be not among winebibbers among rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous eaters of fleſh: riotous eaters of fleſh,</hi> there is ſurfeiting, and <hi>Wine bibbers,</hi> there is drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe; Wee ſee what care and caution the wiſe man would have us uſe leaſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:108344:76"/> wee bee intangled in theſe ſinnes.</p>
            <p>A man ſhould not ſo much as keepe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany commonly with ſuch as they that are thus. If we know a man that is infected with the plague of Peſtilence, we ſhunne him, and uſe care and caution, we will not come neare him for feare of infection, becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeemes to imply ſuch a thing, he would not have us to be with drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, or with thoſe that are given to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting; <hi>be not with Wine bibbers, or riotous ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fleſh,</hi> leaſt by converſing with them, by their counſell and example, they draw thee to the participation of their fault.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12.15.</note>And ſo for covetouſneſſe in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Take heede and beware of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe;</hi> marke it, Chriſt is not content to give a ſingle charge, but hee doubles it, <hi>Take heede and beware.</hi> It is not onely enough to have a wary head, to eſpie (as the phraſe is borrowed from Souldiers that ſtand Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell, to eſpie ſuch as come) but to guard themſelves, to harneſſe themſelves, to be able to withſtand, ſo the word imports, being a word borrowed from watchmen, thoſe that guard Princes or great men, while they ſleepe, their guard ſtands to repulſe dangers that may come neare them. <hi>Take heede and beware of covetouſneſſe.</hi> You ſee wee ought to have a care, and take heede of theſe ſinnes, and of theſe eſpecially.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:108344:76"/>
            <p>The reaſons why we ought to be carefull of theſe ſins are,</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> Chriſt would not have given us charge,<note place="margin">There is danger in theſe ſins.</note> that we ſhould not fall into them. The word here <hi>Take heede,</hi> implies danger.</p>
            <q>The danger is double.</q>
            <p>One is in the Text, becauſe theſe ſinnes burden the heart, they overcharge the ſoule. As a man that is clogged and overburdened with a great weight, he is not able to lift up himſelfe to doe any other worke; ſo it is with ſurfeiting, and drunkenneſſe and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, they overcharge and burden the heart; they make a man that is poſſeſt with them, not able to lift up himſelfe, to performe holy and ſpirituall duties, to pray, or to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, or to performe any other pious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. That is the firſt danger then, they bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the heart therefore they had neede to take heede of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they not onely burthen the heart but with a ſpeciall burden, ſuch as when it hath gotten on a man, when a man is ſunke under it, hee is not able eaſily to disburden himſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is a good obſervation. There are few
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:108344:77"/> that are given to epicuriſme to drunkenneſſe or covetouſneſſe, that are reclaymed. They are a burthen that is hardly layd off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.11.</note> In <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.11. the Prophet ſpeakes expreſly <hi>of wine, and now wine, they take away the heart,</hi> that is, they that are given to wine and to new wine, to drunkenneſſe, I may adde alſo they that are given to their belly to epicuriſme, to ſatisfie their ſenſuall apetite when once they are given to it they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe; thoſe ſinnes, when they have gotten poſſeſſion they ſtill keepe it, it is a miracle almoſt if one of them recover.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of it is this, becauſe it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of thoſe ſinnes, they ſlumber the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they caſt a man into a dead ſleepe, they make him in ſuch a caſe that hee ſtands in no awe of the threatnings nor judgements of God, whereby hee might be reclaymed, and awaked out of his ſecuritie: that for the two firſt.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.4.</note> Then for covetouſneſſe in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>no man that warreth entangleth himſelfe with the affaires of this life.</hi> Marke, The Apoſtle compares cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe to a ſnare, as when a bird or a beaſt is entangled in a ſnare, when men entangle themſelves in pleaſures, and in covetouſneſſe it is a ſnare; and when they are once entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it is a hundred to one if they recover it. <hi>No man that warreth entangleth himſelfe.</hi> He compareth covetouſneſſe to a ſnare. You
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108344:77"/> ſee then there is a double danger, why wee ſhould be cautionate: Firſt there is a danger in the ſinnes, they burden the ſoule, and with ſuch a burden that a man cannot eaſily depoſe when he is ſunke under it.</p>
            <p>But that is not all, there is another danger <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> beſides; as there is danger in the ſinnes,<note place="margin">There is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into theſe ſinnes.</note> ſo there is danger of our falling into theſe ſins: otherwiſe it mattered not, we might bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and retchleſſe though there were dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in them, if there were not danger of our falling into them, but there is danger of that, therefore in that reſpect we ought to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate, and that in three reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is danger of falling into thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſinnes whereof wee have often occaſion fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to commit:<note place="margin">Becauſe of daily occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Now wee daily eate and drinke, wee daily provide for this life, wee have continually every day occaſion to eate to ſurfeiting, to drinke to drunkenneſſe, to provide to covetouſneſſe: there is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into theſe ſinnes, becauſe the occaſion and matter of them is ſo frequent. It is otherwiſe with other ſinnes, a thiefe or an adulterer have not alway an opportunity, at leaſt not daily oppportunitie to commit thoſe ſinnes, but for theſe there are occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and opportunities alwayes at hand, therefore there is more danger of falling into them then others.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <note place="margin">They border on lawfull things.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Againe there is a great deale of danger of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:108344:78"/> falling into them, becauſe they are placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the confines, and border of lawfull things, for oft times, through our blindneſſe and miſguided affection, that which is lawfull impoſeth upon us, and carries us to that which is unlawfull. What ſaith the Epicure? Is it not lawfull to enjoy Gods creatures li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally? therefore hee will gorge himſelfe, and give way to his greedy ſenſuall appetite. What ſaith the drunkard? hath not God ordained Wine to refreſh man? therefore he will drowne and overwhelme himſelfe with drunkenneſſe. So ſaith the covetous Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, Is not a man bound to provide for this life things <hi>honeſt before God and men?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may make mony his God, and devote himſelfe to the world. Thus that which is lawfull impoſeth on us, and carries us to that which is unlawfull. Now ſurfeiting borders upon that which is lawfull: it is lawfull to eate, but to goe beyond the due bounds it is ſurfeiting; it is lawfull to drinke, but beyond the due meaſure is drunkenneſſe: It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to care for the things of this world, but if it be beyond the meaſure, eyther unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for the time, or immoderate, then we become guilty of covetouſneſſe. Theſe things border on things that are lawfull, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> therefore themſelves are moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.<note place="margin">They have affinitie with nature.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is moſt danger of falling
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108344:78"/> into thoſe ſinnes which have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt affinitie and cognition with our nature, thoſe that have much nature in them, it is eaſieſt to fall into them. It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for us to eate and to drinke, and to provide, for this life, nature prompts us to this. Now the motions of nature eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of corrupt nature, are vehement, and often tranſport us from that which is naturall, to the doing of that which is unnaturall. The reaſon is, becauſe there is much in them that is naturall. It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to eate and to drinke, and to provide for this life, therefore from thence wee are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed oft times by the violent motion of corrupt nature to that which is unlawfull. So here is a double danger. Firſt in the ſinnes, if wee fall into them. Secondly, there is a danger of our falling into theſe ſinnes. This ſhall ſuffice to bee ſpoken for the proofe of the point.</p>
            <p>I come now to make uſe of that which <label type="milestone">

               <note place="margin">To limit our ſelves in things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note>The firſt is this, to limit and reſtraine our ſelves in the uſe of thoſe things about which theſe ſinnes are ordinarily committed. To preſcribe, and in things indifferent (as it were) to ſtraiten and limit our ſelves, to lay harder lawes upon our ſelves then God hath: for the rule of S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> is moſt true,<note place="margin">S.

               <hi>Hee that would not offend in things unlawfull, muſt oft abridge himſelfe in things lawfull.</hi> Let us not eate as much as wee may. I ſay not as much only as nature will beare, or as wee have ſtrength; but not ſo much as God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. Let us not drinke ſo much as wee may. And in a holy contempt of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things; let us not care, and carke for the world ſo much as wee may: or elſe wee ſhall find by wofull experience, that if wee goe to the outmoſt border, and skirts of that which is lawfull, wee ſhall eaſily come to that which is unlawfull. If once we come juſt to the croſſe line, the divell will put hard to make us goe beyond it. It is a good ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that doubtfull Authour, ſaith he, He that ſleepes upon the very edge, and brinke of a <hi>precipis,</hi> or downfall, it is a thouſand to one but hee falls: that is the firſt thing, to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves in theſe things, not to eate ſo much as we may; nay, not ſo much as God allowes: not becauſe it is unlawfull, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108344:80"/> it may be in-expedient? and not to drinke ſo much as we may, not to carke and care ſo much as we may.

That is the firſt rule.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that which the Apoſtle advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.18.<note place="margin">To ſet our mindes on better things Epheſ. 5.18.</note> that our hearts bee not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, ſaith he, <hi>bee not overcome with wine, wherein is exceſſe, but bee filled with the Spirit.</hi> Marke it, the way not to bee filled with wine, is to be filled with the Spirit.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Wee muſt herein imitate Chirurgions, who when a man is taken with a dangerous bleeding at the noſe, the Chirurgeon opens another veine, he lets him bloud there to divert, and turne the bloud another way: ſo let us, when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves to have an immoderate ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening appetite after corporall food, let us turne the edge of our appetite another way; labour to have an appetite after heavenly dainties; and that will abate, and dull our appetite after earthly things; or take away the immoderation of it. So when wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive wee have an immoderate thirſt after wine, and ſtrong drinke, let us labour for a ſpirituall thirſt after the pleaſures that runne and flow in a full channell, at Gods right hand for ever; When wee find an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

That is the fourth Rule, to be frequent in the meditation of the laſt day, this will take away the edge of our immoderate deſires of the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

            <p>For ſurfeiting, they thinke it ſometimes lawfull to give liberty, and reynes, to bee overcharged with it: As at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> the time of the comming of Chriſt, as if they could not celebrate the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, except themſelues become fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

And ſo, on the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, as if by celebrating of holy dayes, they muſt needs become unholy.</p>
            <p>And ſo in ſome times, people thinke it not onely unlawfull, but that they are bound to be drunke, as at Nuptialls, or at the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a King, they thinke it a point of duty to bee drunke that day, and they that are not drunke then (as they ſayd to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late) hee is not Ceſars friend.</hi> And ſo at the meeting of friends, as if they could not meet friendly, and courteouſly, except they bee enemies to themſelves, or as if they could not expreſſe humanitie unleſſe by drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they overwhelme and looſe it.

            <p>And ſo for the third, <hi>the cares of this life,</hi> ſome men are ſo farre from thinking of, and uſing this caution alway, that they thinke they may ſometimes ſuffer their hearts to be overcharged with the cares of this life.

            </p>
            <p>Let us remember wee deale with ſuch an enemie as will give us no truce, nor reſt: ſuch a one as with whom wee can never have peace or truce, that daily layes waite to ſubvert us, that layes ſnares in our meate, and drinke, and the things of this life: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith well,<note place="margin">S.

But it is not ſo with our ſpirituall enemies, wee are ſurrounded with ſpirituall enemies, that not only watch all opportunities, and take all advantages, but they know when wee give them advantage, when wee are ſecure and retchleſſe, and they take it. Therefore it concernes us to looke, leſt at any time our hearts be overcharged.</p>
            <p>Let us not plead difficultie, and ſay it is a thing hard to ſtand upon our guard, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy our ſelves.

So let us lay this continuall care and caution in the one ballance, and the benefit that wee have by it in the other ballance, and wee ſhall never grudge at our care. Let us thinke with our ſelves, while this care laſts, we are free from all other care; and who would not care for a while upon condition to be eternally ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after.</p>

            <p>It ſeemes then, <hi>It is the Propertie of theſe ſinnes, ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life, to overcharge the heart,</hi> That is the point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take heed,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>leſt at any time your hearts bee overcharged.</hi> It implies that it is the propertie of theſe ſinnes here mentioned to overcharge the heart. Looke what a milſtone, or a talent of lead, is to the body, the ſame are theſe ſinnes to the ſoule; (which is meant by the heart; as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>the hidden man of the heart;</hi> that is, the hidden man of the ſoule) they over-preſſe, and burden the ſoule: ſo much the Word here uſed implies, and imports in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt your hearts bee overcharged.</hi> The Word comming from <hi>Balos,</hi> that ſignifies no ordinarie, portable burden, but a grievous oppreſſing burden (as the Etimologiſts have it:) ſuch as cannot belifted, but with an extraordinarie ſtrength, with a Giants arme: ſuch are theſe ſinnes to

            <p>Now the grievouſneſſe of this burden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by theſe two things;</p>
            <p>Firſt, theſe ſinnes are ſuch a burden to the ſoule, as preſſe the ſoule, as preſſe the ſoule from heaven to earth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they are ſuch a burden, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they bee disburdened, except we acquit our ſelves of them, they will preſſe our ſoules downe from earth to hell.</p>

               </gap>e indeed. As for two of them, the two firſt; ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, they diſable a man from worldly performances, therefore much more from heavenly and ſpirituall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
            <p>For the other the cares of this life; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, they burden the ſoule no leſſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108344:89"/> then the former, though I grant it is more ſlilie and inſenſibly: nay, they burden the ſoule in theſe two reſpects more.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, they burden the ſoule but now and then, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: no man is continually ſurfeiting, or drunke: but when Covetouſneſſe oppreſſeth the ſoule, it doth it conſtantly, it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall burden; therefore in that reſpect they burden the ſoule more then the former.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, they burden the ſoule, not immediatly, but by the body, they burden the body the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the ſoule, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the ſoule, but Covetouſneſſe burdens the ſoule immediatly, it hangs a weight, as a plummet of lead upon every facultie of the ſoule, ſo that the ſoule cannot lift it ſelfe to any ſpirituall dutie: it hangs a plummet of Lead upon every power of the ſoule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it becomes bowed and bended to the earth.</p>
            <p>Will you ſee the truth of this in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars? The higheſt, and nobleſt facultie of the ſoule, is the underſtanding, that whereby we apprehend, and judge of things, now covetouſneſſe clogges, and burdens the underſtanding. Take a covetous man, there is no man ſo dull, to apprehend ſpirituall things as he. Indeed in matters of the world, talke with him in his owne ſpheare of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108344:90"/> world, and worldly things, there I grant, he is quicke and nimble enough, if not above, yet equall with others; for the moſt part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others. It fares with a covetous man, as it is with the Moone, when the Moone is inlightned in that part that is toward the earth, commonly it is moſt darke in that part that is towards heaven,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſo it is in this: there is ignorance of ſpirituall things, oft times where there is the greateſt light to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the things of the world. I ſay, talke with ſuch a one in his own ſpheare, of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world, and the things of it, hee is quicke and nimble enough, but come to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, that concerne the life to come, and there hee is a very <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> he underſtands nothing. Covetouſneſſe is to the underſtanding like the nayle of <hi>Iael:</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>Iael</hi> drove the nayle through <hi>Siſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi> temples when hee was aſleepe, and faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his head to the ground: ſo covetouſneſſe faſteneth the head, the underſtanding to the ground, that it cannot lift up it ſelfe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and underſtand the things of the Spirit: wee ſee then Covetouſneſſe it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the chiefe facultie of the ſoule, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
            <p>And ſo for the other faculties, the will and the affections it burdens them, it makes the will and the affections of a man, when once it poſſeſſeth them, like the woman in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108344:90"/> the Goſpell, that had a diſeaſe and infirmitie 18. yeares, ſaith the Text, ſhee was bowed together, that ſhee could no way lift up her ſelfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.1.<note place="margin">Luke 13:1.</note> So it is with a covetous man, it bowes the will to the ground, that hee is not able to lift up himſelfe to a through proſecution of that that is good, or to a conſtant declining, and flight from that which is ſpiritually ill.</p>
            <p>And ſo for the affections it bowes them to the ground, that they are not able to lift up themſelves to deſire, and delight in any thing that is heavenly, not to love, and joy in any thing, but ſuch as are earthly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall. I ſay, it bends them ſo to the ground, that they cannot conſtantly delight in theſe things. I grant that a covetous man for a fit, for a while, his will and affections may lift up themſelves a little; but they are not able to hold out, the greatneſſe of the weight beares him downe againe, and oppreſſeth him. Hee that hath his heart overcharged with covetouſneſſe, and ſo with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, he may for a while lift up himſelfe: as a man that is oppreſt with a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that gets the upper hand of him, and beares him downe. Covetouſneſſe bowes the underſtanding, the will and affections to the ground.</p>
            <p>And not only theſe, but likewiſe the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and memorie, and ſpeech too, it burdens
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108344:91"/> thoſe. Take a man that is covetous, his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination workes, and exerciſeth it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things of the world. For his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, it treaſures up nothing, or but little elſe beſides theſe. And ſo for his ſpeech, the ſpeech of a covetous man,<note place="margin">Simile</note> it is as the breath of a dying man: Wee ſay that when a man approacheth to death, his breath is earthly, ſo it is with the Diſcourſe of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man, it is of the earth. It burdens the fancie, and memorie, and ſpeech of a man: ſo that hee dreames of nothing, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers nothing, hee ſpeakes of nothing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, with delight, ordinarily, but that which is earthly. You ſee then that Chriſt might well ſay, <hi>take heed leſt your hearts bee overcharged with ſurfeiting, and drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life:</hi> for it is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of theſe ſinnes to overcharge the heart, as it is of a burden to preſſe downe, firſt from heaven to earth, but that is not all.</p>

               <note place="margin">Why men feele not the burden of their ſinnes.</note>I anſwer, it is true, they feele not the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of them; the reaſon of it is this, becauſe it is the propertie of theſe ſinnes to take away the ſenſe of them; the burden is not the leſſe, becauſe they feele it not; becauſe it is the propertie of theſe ſinnes to beſot the ſoule and make it inſenſible that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive the burden. The wiſe man ſaith as much of drunkenneſſe,<note place="margin">Prov. 23. ult.</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. ſaith he, <hi>thou ſhalt be,</hi> that is, if thou give thy ſelfe to drunkenneſſe <hi>as one that lyeth in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Sea, or the top of a Maſt.</hi> The wiſe man reſembles a drunken man to a man that lies on the toppe of a Maſt in a great ſtorme when there is danger, when the ſhippe and the Maſt reels, he lies there and thinkes not of it, in his drunkenneſſe he feeles it not. And then in the laſt verſe ſaith he, <hi>they have ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me and I was not ſicke, they have beaten me and I felt it not.</hi> It is the propertie of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to make a man inſenſible of the wounds and plagues that hee receives by it. I grant that they that are adicted to theſe ſinnes they
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108344:92"/> feele not the burden, becauſe it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of theſe ſinnes to take away the ſenſe of them; but what then? becauſe they feele not the burden of them is it the leſſe? Nay it is greater becauſe it is not felt. As the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians ſay of diſeaſes, of all diſeaſes thoſe are moſt dangerous that are not felt. And that is the reaſon that a Conſumption it is hard to be cured becauſe it is hard to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned till it have eaten and waſted the body ſo much that it is almoſt impoſſible to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. When it is eaſie to be cured it is almoſt impoſſible to bee diſcerned, and when it is eaſie to be diſcerned, it is almoſt impoſſible to be cured. As of all diſeaſes of the body thoſe that are moſt dangerous that are not felt: So of all the burthens of the ſoule thoſe are moſt dangerous that are not felt. The reaſon is, becauſe the feeling of the danger makes men ſeeke for remedy, and labour to be disburthened of them when they feele the burthen; but when men feele not the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that lies on them, they ſeeke not for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, that is the firſt anſwer.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly if they feele not the burthen now, the time ſhall come that they ſhall feele it, eyther when God opens their eyes to ſee the grievouſneſſe of their ſinnes, and to give them the grace of repentance; or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after when they ſhall preſſe the ſoule to the bottome of hell. Firſt, if God open their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108344:93"/> eyes then they will bee ſenſible of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. It is with ſinne, as the Philoſophers ſay it is with heavie elements: it is a rule in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie that an element in its proper place is not heavy, that is, it exerciſeth not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its heavineſſe. If a man lye under water though all the water be above him hee feeles not the weight of it; the reaſon is, becauſe the water is in its proper place. So in a Well or Pumpe, when a man drawes a bucket of water, he feeles it not while it is under water, but when it is above water, he feeles the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of it. So, as long as men lie under theſe ſinnes, when God gives them not a hand to lift them up, they feele not the burthen of them; but if God reach a hand of grace to lift them up, and open their eyes to ſee the grievouſneſſe of their ſinnes, they feele the burthen of them, and goe and importune the throne of grace and deſire to bee disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, that is the firſt thing.</p>
            <p>But if they feele it not ſo, that God open their conſcience, and their eyes here, they ſhall feele the burden of it hereafter. I told you what the Apoſtle ſaith, and what hee ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> I ſay to you, that <hi>drunkards</hi> and <hi>covetous,</hi> I may ſay it of <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting</hi> alſo, they that are guilty of theſe things <hi>ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God.</hi> They preſſe the ſoule to hell, and though for the preſent they take away the ſenſe of them,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108344:93"/> yet afterwards, when it is paſt redreſſe men ſhall be ſenſible enough of the burden.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as it may ſerve for caution,<note place="margin">To uſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt theſe ſinnes.</note> to <label type="milestone">

So wee doe in other things, when a burthen reſts upon our body, or eſtate, or name, wee are carefull and diligent to be disburthened of them. Shall we be carefull of our bodies, of our eſtates, and of our name, and ſhall wee not of our ſoules? doe wee deſire that thoſe may be free from burthens, and doe we not deſire that our ſoules may be free? It is the exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. ſaith he, <hi>ſince we are compaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, let us lay aſide every weight that preſſeth downe, and runne with patience the race that is ſet before us.</hi> It is the advice of the Apoſtle to lay downe every weight that we may runne with patience the race that is ſet before us. Now ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe and the cares of this life, or covetouſneſſe, are weights and clogs that burthen the ſoule and hinder a man, not onely from running the race that is ſet before him, but they hin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der him from ſo much as going; when a man is ſunke under this burthen hee is not able to ſteppe or ſet one foote before another in this way: therefore we had neede to be diligent

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, let us goe to Chriſt, for as it is Chriſt that beares our burden for us,<note place="margin">Goe to Chriſt for his Spirit.</note> ſo hee likewiſe is able to take our burthen from us. Let us goe to him, and deſire him to ſend his Spirit into our hearts, that is, a Spirit of ſtrength and power able to lift off theſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. For as I told you, when he ſaith heere <hi>take heed leaſt your hearts be overcharged,</hi> it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108344:94"/> ſuch a burthen as is a grievous oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing burthen, ſuch as cannot bee lifted but with a Giants arme, ſuch a burthen are theſe ſinnes, they oppreſſe the ſoule, and none but the Spirit of God can eaſe us of them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us goe to Chriſt and deſire him to ſend his Spirit into our hearts to eaſe us of this burthen. Looke as it is with thoſe that are troubled with the <hi>Incubus,</hi> the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare, when they feele a great weight and burthen on them, they put forth all their power to free themſelves of it; ſo when we finde this <hi>Incubus,</hi> this ſpirituall Night-mare to lye on us, and to preſſe, not onely our bodies but our ſoules, wee ſhould uſe all our ſtrength and power to bee free that ſo we may runne with patience the race that is ſet before us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, let us uſe the meanes, (beſides theſe there are ſome meanes to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> uſed) to disburden our ſelves.<note place="margin">To practiſe the contrary.</note> What are thoſe? Looke as in Phyſicke the rule is; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries are cured by contraries: ſo if we have burthened our ſelves by ſurfeiting, let us disburthen our ſelves by the contrary: if we have burthened our ſelves by eating immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, let us put the knife to our throate abridge our ſelves in the uſe of meate, not to eate ſo much as we may doe: for as I ſayd before out of that doubtfull author, he that will goe in the uſe of indifferent things as
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:108344:95"/> farre as he may, to the utmoſt length of his tether, it is a thouſand to one but that man will offend. He that ſleepes upon the pitch or brinke of a downfall or <hi>Precipis,</hi> it is twentie to one but hee falls. And ſo for drunkenneſſe if our hearts and ſoules be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the exceſſive uſe of ſtrong drinke: ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>rather then I will offend my brother I will not eate fleſh while I live;</hi> if the Apoſtles argument be good, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then I will offend my brother, I will not eate fleſh, the argument will hold thus too, that rather then we wil offend our ſelves, and burthen our ſoules, we will not drinke ſtrong drinke while we live.</p>
            <p>Let us labour thus to take a kinde of holy revenge on our ſelves, ſo the Apoſtle calls it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. ſaith hee, <hi>Behold this ſelfe ſame thing that you ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what clearing of your ſelves, what revenge it hath wrought.</hi> I ſay thus we ſhould take a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall revenge of our ſelves, that if we have beene overſhot in the uſe of meate or drinke and exceeded our bounds, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we limit and abridge our ſelves, and take a kinde of revenge of our ſelves.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> Thirdly and laſtly, if it bee the propertie of theſe ſinnes to burden the heart: then
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108344:95"/> here take notice briefly of the perverſe judgement of the world,<note place="margin">The falſe judgement of the world.</note> how contrary it is to the judgement of our Saviour: aske the world who have the lighteſt, and merrieſt hearts of all men; They will tell you thoſe that fare daintily, that are good fellowes, they are joviall and merrie hearts. But aske Chriſt, and hee will tell us that ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe opreſſe the heart; they have not (as the world would make us beleeve) light-ſome hearts. It is true, if wee will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve their faces, they ſeeme to have light-ſome hearts, if we will judge of their hearts by their fleiring, and laughter: but <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Prov. 14.13.</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. <hi>That even in that laughter the heart is ſorrowfull:</hi> there is ſorrow in their laughter, it is but from the teeth outward, and it is not ſo only for the preſent, <hi>but the end of that mirth is heavineſſe.</hi> It is ſorrow for the preſent, and the concluſion is heavineſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore whatſoever the world ſaith, Epicures and drunken men, ſuch as are given to the immoderate uſe of meate and drinke, thoſe men have the heavieſt hearts. Let the world ſay what it will, the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is chearefull, he hath a lightſome heart. Saith Chriſt, <hi>Come unto mee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> 
               <hi>all yee that are wearie, and heavy laden, and you ſhall find reſt to your ſoules; Take my yoake upon you, for my yoake is eaſie.</hi> Chriſts yoake is eaſie, hee that hath given his name to Chriſt, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:108344:96"/> ſets himſelfe conſtantly to the performance of ſpirituall duties, hee hath a lightſome heart. Nay, whereas all other things, they may bee burthened, his body, and his eſtate may be burthened for a while, and his name may be burthened for a while, but his heart is light and merrie. Therefore as the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaith, <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can beare?</hi> But if the heart be well, it will beare a mans infirmities: ſo long as a mans heart is light: as long as the burthen lies in a mans body, or his name, or eſtate, if the heart bee light they may bee borne. Of all men, a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, a good man, a conſcientious man hath the lightſomeſt heart. This ſhall ſuffice to bee ſpoken of the fourth part in generall, what wee are to take heed of, leſt our hearts be burthened. I told you it is the propertie of theſe things to burthen the heart.</p>
            <p>Now I come in the next place more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to tell you, what wee are to take heed of, that our hearts bee not overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſurfeiting. <hi>Take heed leſt your hearts bee oppreſſed at any time</hi>
               <q>With ſurfeiting.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That is, with riotous, immoderate exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive eating. The word in the originall is <hi>Clifani.</hi> The ſenſe and derivation of the word is borrowed from thoſe two paines and diſtempers of the head that is cauſed by ſympathie, and conſent of the head with
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108344:96"/> the ſtomacke, through diſtemper of ryot, and inordinate eating. In the Latine it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies thoſe crudities that are cauſed in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke through immoderate exceſſive eating, when the heart is ſurcharged, when there is more meat then it is able to digeſt. Thence it is that Chriſt wiſheth us here to take heed; <hi>Take heed to your ſelves,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>leſt your hearts bee overcharged with ſurfeiting.</hi> Now looke what Chriſt charged his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, hee chargeth us alſo as I told you out of <hi>Marke</hi> 13. <hi>ult.

            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:108344:97"/>

            <p>But why are wee to take heed that our hearts be not overcharged with ſurfeiting?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, becauſe if our hearts bee <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> overcharged,<note place="margin">It unfits us for good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> wee are unfit to performe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall duties. I told you before, ſurfeiting burtheneth and overchargeth the ſoule, and makes it heavie, and lumpiſh, not able to lift up it ſelfe to performe any ſpirituall dutie. It is a pretty conceit of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> in his firſt Homilie on <hi>Geneſis:</hi> that <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Chryſoſt. Gen. hom. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> when he came from the Mount, and brought the two tables of the commandements with him, when he perceived the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to whom he came, that they had filled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves full, and betooke themſelves to dauncing, and ſporting themſelves, ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> he tooke the Tables, and threw them downe; Why? hee thought it an abſurd, and unfit thing to give comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements for them to obſerve, who now had gorged themſelves with meate. No man is ſo unfit for the ſervice of God, to obſerve the commandements of God, as thoſe that have ſurfeited, and filled themſelves with
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108344:98"/> meate. So, likewiſe ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeiting:</hi> In the next verſe but one, ſaith he, <hi>Watch, and pray alway,</hi> hee oppoſeth watching and prayer to ſurfeiting. Thoſe that have their hearts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharged with ſurfeiting cannot watch and pray, and performe ſpirituall duties. Now therefore the firſt reaſon why wee ſhould bee heedfull that our hearts bee not overcharged with ſurfeiting, is becauſe it makes our ſoules unfit for the performance of ſpirituall duties, it makes us unapt for the doing of that for which wee came into the world.</p>

            <p>Phyloſophers ſay that when a man hath eaten ſomewhat he is lighter then when hee faſts, and they give the reaſon, becauſe the Spirits are more refreſhed; I diſpute not that probleme, I thinke the contrary that a man is not lighter, though he be in his heart, yet he is not in the skales or ballance: but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually when a man is faſting he is more active and quicke for the performance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall duties.

            <p>But that is not all, there is another glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in reſpect of the time, that is,<note place="margin">Spending too much time in eating.</note> when they beſtow too much time and ſtay too long in ſatisfying of their appetite, (I meane not upon extraordinary occaſions at feaſts, &amp;c. for then we may ſeeke for delicacies, and we may ſit longer then at othertimes, but) when we ordinarily ſit an houre, or two, or three houres at a meale, when wee doe not make it as we ſhould doe, a by thing, but we make it our worke, and our imployment. Wee complaine that our time here is ſhort; but as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, we may finde fault with our ſelves that it is ſo ſhort. How eaſie is it for a man to ſatisfie nature ſoone, and betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his generall or particular calling? Now when we ſhall ſpend not halfe an houre but an houre, or two or three houres, and ſit all night before we can riſe from meate: this is a kinde of ſurfeiting; we deprive our ſelves of our time. This is not to redeeme time, but to ſpend time and our ſelves, that that God hath given us for the doing good to our ſelves and others, we caſt it away care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly in ſuperfluities upon our ſelves. Wee ſpeake to men, and tell them, if they deſire a bleſſing on themſelves, and to keepe the judgements of God from them, let them be diligent in their callings, and pray in their families, and in their cloſets; alas, they are ſo full of imployments they cannot ſpare
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108344:103"/> time to pray with their charge, yet they can ſpend two or three houres, ſometimes a whole day in viſiting their friends, and in holding an idle chat with others, they can ſpend three or foure houres ſitting at meales. How much better were it, to take away ſome time, to improve and redeeme time (that we caſt away) for examining our ſelves upon our beds? to goe and make our peace with God, to ſearch and try our ſelves? Thus we become guilty of gluttony, and ſurfeiting, not onely in reſpect of the quantitie, by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too much, and in reſpect of the qualitie in curioſitie; (<hi>Ahab</hi> did not ſearch more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly for <hi>Eliah,</hi> through the land then ſome doe after delicacies) but alſo in reſpect of the time, when wee eate in the morning, (though it be not abſolutely unlawfull, but) when we ſo eate as to make us unfit for good duties, as when we eate too long, or eate in the times of humiliation, when there is no neceſſitie of eating, as in the times of faſting. Some men are made ſuch ſlaves to their appetite, that if it bid them come, they muſt come, if it bid them provide ſuch a diſh they muſt have it.

God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us libertie to eate meate, and any kind of meate, if it be in our calling, and wee be able to provide for our ſelves with the cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before mentioned; but theſe men loſe their libertie, they bring themſelves into ſuch an eſtate, that they cannot want it. There are ſome men, let them want Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, or ſuch a diſh as they devote themſelves to, they cannot live. This is that that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, in 1 <hi>Corin. is to bring a mans ſelfe under the power of a thing.</hi> Saith the Apoſtle, it is lawfull for a man to eate any thing, but ſaith he, <hi>I will not bring my ſelfe under the power of any thing.</hi> How doth a man bring himſelfe under the power of any thing? When a man yeelds too much to his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, that hee is brought to this paſſe, that hee is a ſlave to his appetite: if it call for ſuch a diſh, hee muſt have it; if it call for ſuch viands, he cannot be without them: Then a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108344:104"/> man is brought under the power of meate. In uſing our libertie, if wee doe not looke to it, we may loſe our libertie.</p>
            <p>If wee examine our ſelves by theſe rules, wee ſhall find that there are few, but they are guiltie of ſurfeiting, not only in reſpect of quantitie, when they are immoderate, but in regard of qualitie, when they are too deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and in reſpect of time, as we ſee in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 6. <hi>They did eate the calves out of the ſtall; and the lambes out of the flocke,</hi> when God called for humiliation; <hi>they remembred not the afflictions of Ioſeph.</hi> And laſt of all, when wee are too carefull to provide our ſelves before hand, or elſe are too much tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the uſe of meate, by theſe meanes wee become guiltie of ſurfeiting. Therefore we ſhould follow the adviſe of our Saviour here, <hi>take heed leſt at any time our hearts bee overcharged with ſurfeiting.</hi>

            <p>And for this inquiry I confeſſe there is not any thing ſpecified in the Text: but I appeale to any judicious auditour if it be not herein implyed. My Text being like a well couched building, wherein the ſtones and onely the principall materialls are in the view, but the Cement and Morter is undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable; <hi>If yee be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Admirable is the logick and ſinewes of our Apoſtle in this place, affecting here ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrength of ſence, then language, and pregnancie of reaſon above eminencie of words.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Two reaſons inforcing the ſeeking things above.</note>Two reaſons I finde eſpecially, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words are grounded, which as the foundation in the architecture gives ſtrong ſupport to the whole: eyther of them able to infer, both together to enforce this duty.</p>
            <pb n="197" facs="tcp:108344:106"/>
            <p>There was great reaſon that the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> now riſen with Chriſt, ſhould <hi>ſeeke thoſe things that are above,</hi> whether wee looke to the direct beames above, or the reflect beames on themſelves, whether wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<q>God that rayſed them,</q> 
               <hi>or</hi>
               <q>Themſelves that were rayſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, in reſpect of God that raiſed them; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by way of common thankfulneſſe,<note place="margin">In reſpect of God.</note> to give their future life to him that had given them life; to imploy thoſe gifts and graces that they had ſo lately received from his hands in his ſervice, to the honour of the doner. An argument in the ballance of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle, weightie and ponderous; therefore when elſe where hee goes about to urge the <hi>Romans</hi> to the like duty; as one that well knew how potent above the reſt this was, he makes choyſe of this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.13.</note> 
               <hi>give not your members weapons of unrighteouſneſſe to ſinne, but give your ſelves to God:</hi> Why? <hi>As thoſe that are alive from the dead;</hi> or becauſe you are quickned with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Every bleſſing that God beſtowes upon us, is or ſhould be ſo many reall perſwaſions,<note place="margin">Spirituall bleſsings ſpeciall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations.</note> and bonds and obligations to tye, and bind us to obedience: but ſpirituall bleſſings, ſuch as the rayſing of theſe <hi>Colloſsians</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Text, they lay ſo much a ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter bond on us, by how much more they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108344:107"/> be excellent in themſelves, and beneficiall to us. The time once was that the <hi>Colloſsians</hi> were <hi>darkeneſſe, but now they are light in the Lord.</hi> They were once the vaſſels of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but now they are the ſervants of Chriſt; they were once <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes,</hi> but now they are <hi>alive, rayſed from the dead.</hi> Sinewes of Braſſe, a heart of Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant and Steele, muſt needs relent in the fence and memory of ſuch a mercy, to bend it to holy and gracious duties.</p>
            <p>It is the ignorance of men to thinke that the doctrine of Chriſt is a doctrine of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall libertie, that the Goſpel is a Charter, and immunitie from obedience, at leaſt from that ſtrict obedience to which men were ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Law. As if becauſe God hath done more for us then for them, therefore wee ſhould doe leſſe for him; that becauſe we are eaſed of that clog of ceremonies, and ſuch burdens, we might load our ſelves with more guilt; and becauſe hee hath purchaſed our freedome from ſinne, therefore wee might take freedome to ſinne: or becauſe with theſe <hi>Colloſsians</hi> we are quickned with Chriſt, therefore wee may <hi>crucifie afreſh the Lord of life</hi> by unlawfull courſes, and as much as in us lies ſtill hinder our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving.</p>
            <p>I would to God this age had afforded no ſuch ſophiſters, in whom prophaneneſſe,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108344:107"/> like a diſtemper hath turned the Phyſicke adminiſtred for their cure to a diſeaſe, that hath made theſe mercies of God one pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull pretence to ſinne, and an occaſion to looſe the reines, and to poure out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all wickedneſſe. How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the practice of that gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother?<note place="margin">Matth. 8.15.</note> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.15. no ſooner Chriſt had cured her, but preſently ſhee aroſe and miniſtred to him, ſhee conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated the firſt fruits of her health and ſtrength to the ſervice of Chriſt. Nay how much better was the Logick of gracious <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> in whom the memory of his maſters kindneſſe ſhewed in advancing of him, was a ſoveraigne remedy to keepe him from the inchantments of his miſtriſſe; ever upon the review of it concluding how ſhall <hi>I doe this wickedneſſe and ſinne againſt God?</hi>

I hope there are ſome here preſent that with theſe <hi>Colloſsians</hi> in the Text are rayſed already to the life of grace (I pray that all may) and therefore in that reſpect ſtand as deepely bound as they to <hi>ſeeke thoſe things that are above.</hi> If you pleaſe to goe along, and paralell, and lay our happineſſe to the ſcales with theirs, you will confeſſe that we are bound more.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">A greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation on us then thoſe in former times.</note>Firſt, the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> were yet in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie; when the Apoſtle wrote this Epiſtle, the light of the Goſpel, it was but even now broken out amongſt them; thoſe thicke clouds and miſts of Gentiliſme and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition wherein they were formerly wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, were ſcarſe diſpelled. And when once the Sunne was riſen among them, and with his wonted ſpeed haſtned to his height, upon the ſudden he ſet at once, and to them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in perpetuall darkeneſſe. Even this our Apoſtle, though himſelfe were cut off with an untimely end; yet he ſaw theſe <hi>Colloſsians</hi> goe to their grave alive, and were ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an earthquake as <hi>Euſebius</hi> witneſſeth. But for us I appeale to all venerable records of antiquitie, if any time ſince Chriſt hath afforded a Church on which the beames of heaven hath ſhone ſo bright and ſo cleare as on ours? The Goſpell wee have now a long time enjoyed. It is not many yeares agoe ſince they ſayd we were going to our <hi>Clima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctericall</hi> yeare; and almoſt all mens hearts failed them. And if you will believe the world, ſtill there is ſomewhat unlucky com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards us: they will tell us that the concurring of this<note n="*" place="margin">Eaſter day, 1626.</note> day with our Ladies, certainly imports ſome ill. Alas, did not our ſinnes portend worſe then this, wee ſtill might hope that the light of the Goſpell would continue with us, and that Religion
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108344:108"/> ſhould not have a fatall period as it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, theſe <hi>Colloſsians,</hi> though they were novices, and weake; yet they had whole armies and ſquadrons of enemies. Beſides thoſe cunning Sophiſters that went about to put trickes and falacies on them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.4.<note place="margin">Colloſ. 2.4.</note> And beſides a band of Newters that came into the field with mixt colours, bearing partly <hi>Moſes</hi> and partly Chriſt, that pretended to be confederates, but intended to betray them. Beſides theſe there was a troope of Panims, and Pagans, and ſubtill heathen Philoſophers, that with banners diſplayed, and open defiance made warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Salvian</hi> on Colloſ. 2.</note> ſaith <hi>Salvian</hi> upon the ſecond of this Epiſtle. I believe his chronologie failed him; for <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith that that Sect ſprang not up till the ſecond of <hi>Fabian:</hi> But I ſay, ſtill there were ſome adverſaries that made warre againſt them, ſo the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, Chap. 2. Verſ. 8. <hi>Take heede that no man carry you away.</hi> The word there is a military terme expreſſing thoſe <hi>acti ſilogizan</hi> that they uſe to make in hoſtile affaires. But as for us, I muſt confeſſe with ſorrow of heart that too many <hi>Romiſh</hi> dogges there be that lye abroad in the Caves and blinde cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Land, that as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Tim. creepe into ſilly men and womens houſes;</hi> I ſay, the truth is, though there bee too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108344:109"/> 
               <hi>Romiſh</hi> emmiſſaries among us; yet thanks be to God, openly to profeſſe and publikely to maintaine ſuperſtition (as thoſe hypocrites among the <hi>Coloſsians</hi>) they dare not. I hope ſuch hath beene the reſtraint by the force of the Lawes, and ſuch hath beene the care of our Religious King (which God more and more encreaſe) that I hope they never ſhall (and I pray that they never may) prevaile more againſt us. And let thoſe eyes fall out with looking when our Land ſhall bee like them. I will proceede no further in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alell.</p>
            <p>O that wee would every day ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſometime, to account Gods mercies to us; how powerfull would it be to awaken us to <hi>ſeeke thoſe things that are above?</hi> When Satan ſhall ſolicite us to commit any evill, how powerfull would it bee to repulſe him, and to put all by, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> waved his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſe inticement, with a <hi>how ſhall I doe this and ſinne againſt God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if the memory of theſe <hi>Colloſsians</hi> be buried with their Carkaſſes, then I beſeech you caſt your eyes abroad on forraigne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this day, and the miſeries that are on them will reade the mercies of God to you. How many Cities and Countries are there where the ſound of the Goſpell is not? at leaſt not ſincerely preached and heard? But alas, alas, how many are there where the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:108344:109"/> ſound of the Goſpel cannot be heard, for the noyſe of Drummes, the rattling of Armour, the roaring of Canons, and the confuſion of warres that drowne the cry of the Preachers, as they drowned the cry of their children in their ſacrifices to <hi>Moloch?</hi> while wee alone have enjoyed the Goſpel in ſafetie; I would to God with ſinceritie.</p>
            <p>What can we thinke, but that God who hath beſtowed his bleſſings on us with a more liberall hand then upon others, doth expect from us as from the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> (in the Text) that <hi>we ſeeke thoſe things that are above,</hi> more then others? What little comfort will it be to us that wee have had theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, if we goe on in ſinne? the increaſe of Gods bleſſings upon us here, will be an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of our puniſhments hereafter. I conclude the point; then wee make a right uſe of Gods bleſſings when (as water pipes that ſend the water as high as is levell with the head,) what wee receive from the hand of God, wee returne to him againe. This is the firſt ground whereupon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles argument is built. The love of God ſhewed to theſe <hi>Coloſsians</hi> in rayſing them to the life of grace, laying upon them an obligation by way of thankfulneſſe to <hi>ſeeke thoſe things that are above.</hi> The next ground followes.</p>

               <p>We will in the next place by the rule of Logick reſolve this hypotheticall propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into a Catagoricall. <hi>If yee bee riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things that are above.</hi> Thoſe that are riſen with Chriſt ought to ſeeke the things that are above.</p>

               <p>And laſtly to conclude all, I will mention a few arguments of ſome validitie, to ſeeke the things that are above. Of all theſe briefly.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The beſt rule to know the meaning of any Text of Scripture is to compare it with more. It being with this ſacred body, as it is with a Lute, or Inſtrument with ſtrings,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> which by ſtringing one or two you may tune the whole. The knowledge of our Apoſtles Ayme and ſcope in this preſent Chapter it will not a little advantage us in the enquiry of this, what the things above are. Which being (as all the arguments here are) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> to holineſſe; it muſt needs follow by the rules of Logick that by <hi>things above</hi> are eyther meant,</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:108344:113"/>
               <p>Something wherein the nature and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and divine qualities of holines conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Or the practice and poſſeſſion that may be attained.</p>
               <p>Or ſomething bordering upon it.</p>
               <p>The word largely conteines in the reach of it, all things that make for the eternall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the ſoule. All thoſe graces mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle and elſe where. Faith, love, joy, hope, ſinceritie, the feare of God, the remiſſion of ſinnes, peace of conſcience, and freedome from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſinne; all which are wrapped in theſe words, <hi>things above,</hi> which (as it were) is the abridgement of all.</p>
               <p>Which ſpirituall graces, though they bee chiefly meant here; yet I dare not, nor I doe not ſay they are onely meant. It may bee and I thinke verily the Apoſtle lookes further then thus, and by <hi>things above,</hi> hee lookes not onely to the meanes, but to the end: the ſtate of grace and glory. And well may theſe two, grace and glory lye couched in one word, ſince grace and glory differ not in nature but in degrees, grace being nothing but glory begun, and glory being grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſhall in the proceſſe of my enſuing diſcourſe adhere rather to the former; and ſo by <hi>things above,</hi> underſtand eſpecially things concerning the ſtate of grace here;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108344:113"/> here, becauſe though the Apoſtle meant not them onely, yet he immediatly lookes on them, as thoſe that were neareſt, ſo that by theſe <hi>things above</hi> we muſt come if ever, to the ſtate of glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>Theſe things above I underſtand to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts, and graces;<note place="margin">Why called things above.</note> fitly here ſtiled things above.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of the ſource and originall, becauſe they deſerve to challenge the prime place among thoſe perfect gifts that are from above, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.7.<note place="margin">Jam. 1.7.</note> every grace being a ray, and ſtampe of the dietie. That is the firſt reaſon, they are called <hi>things above,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they come from above.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in reſpect of the end, to which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſpirituall graces leade, that is, to heaven which is above; they are as ſo many ſteps to that heavenly <hi>Sion,</hi> and as <hi>Iacob</hi> called that place <hi>Bethel,</hi> the gate or ſubburbs of heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, they are called ſo in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> reference to the place where they ſhall enjoy theſe graces in full perfection, that is, in hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven, above. For ſo it hath pleaſed that wiſe and uncontrollable ſteward to diſpenſe his gifts and graces here, that while wee live here on earth, we onely have the firſt fruits, ſome ſmall handfull of grace; but for the harveſt, the full crop, that is reſerved till we come to heaven above. Therefore they are
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108344:114"/> called <hi>things above</hi> in all theſe reſpects. You ſee then how ſpirituall graces may be ſtiled things above,</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the

                     <item>end to which they leade,</item>
                     <item>place where wee ſhall enjoy them in full meaſure. This ſhall ſuffice for the firſt enquirie concerning the Object, what is meant by <hi>things above,</hi> and why they are ſo called.</item>

The truth is that once man in Paradiſe was like his Maker, bravely accompliſhed with all ſpirituall graces, called here <hi>things above;</hi> but no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did man fall from his due ſubjection, but preſently he was diſrobed of theſe, and ſhut out of Paradiſe.

               <p>As it is with ſome wanton ſtreame that parting from the Ocean,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> runnes all along in the darke windings and paſſages of the earth, till at laſt it breakes up, and when it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth, as aſhamed of its wandring, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returnes with a reſtleſſe unwearied courſe, and ſeekes here and there till it finde the Maine from whence it ſtrayed.

Mee thinkes when I looke abroad in the world, and ſee how buſie men are in the purſuite of earthly things; with what unwearied induſtrie, and diſpoſition they purſue, and with what eager appetite they ſnatch at things below, as if the duſt of the earth were not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to give every man a handfull: methinkes I know not whether to entertaine them with pitty, or with ſcorne.

It is true other men doe not ſeeke after him, but the proud ſcornes to bee beholding to God; therefore before wee can bring our ſelves to ſeeke them we muſt bee convinced of our want of them.

They will anſwer, I have ſo much buſineſſe, I cannot turne my ſelfe to it: Oh the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, and ſtratagems of Sathan! I ſay hee keepes us by this from the exerciſe of devotion by which wee ſhould attaine <hi>the things above,</hi> hee keepes us in the throng of buſineſſe; did I ſay buſineſſe? Nay how many are kept away from this divine exerciſe by ſpending their time fooliſhly in Courtſhip, and I would not
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:108344:119"/> worſe? Whence it comes to paſſe that I looke (I profeſſe) with pitty upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great ones, whoſe lives are a ſtory of ſinne, whoſe ſinnes it comes to paſſe are never cured, becauſe they are alway in motion.</p>
               <p>You that are Gentlemen, ſequeſter ſome time; if not every day, yet at leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very weeke, bid all other buſineſſe ſtand by, and attend on your cloſet to thinke of the things above, how to attaine what you want, and how to increaſe what you have attained. You that are tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, take off your ſelves from other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, retire home and examine your ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eſtate with God.</p>
               <p>And wee that are Schollers ſhould vindicate ſome time from the ſtudy of Bookes to reade our ſelves. All of us ſhould ſet aſide ſome time for the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the things above, to examine what ſpirituall graces wee neede, that wee may uſe the meanes to attaine them, and what ſinnes wee have committed, that wee may repent of them, for feare the ſad time of death come and cut our thread, and then wee goe downe to the <hi>Chambers of death.</hi> Let us examine to what ſinnes wee lye open that wee may fortifie our ſelves againſt them, that the evill
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:108344:119"/> one have no power over us. All theſe things are conteyned in the <hi>things above,</hi> and all theſe wee muſt ſeeke here if wee deſire to attaine the bleſſing of them hereafter. Let this ſuffice to bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the firſt inquirie concerning the meanes whereby to <hi>ſeeke theſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remaines onely two more.</p>
               <p>The characters by which wee may know if we ſeeke theſe things.</p>
               <p>And the motives.</p>
               <p>You ſee how wee ought to <hi>ſeeke the things bove.</hi> But alas,<note place="margin">The ſignes of ſeeking.</note> the over eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite of the things below! wee ſee how coldly and faintly (if at all) wee <hi>ſeeke the things above;</hi> which if wee did ſeeke as wee ought,<note place="margin">Neglect of earthly things.</note> it could not chooſe but abate the edge of our deſires to theſe earthly things, and cauſe us as ſtrangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims to uſe the world as not enjoying it, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayd long before, to make it our ſervant; to bee content like that noble Bird that deſiring to flye aloft, when ſhee is compelled by hunger to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, ſhee unwillingly obeyes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſpatcheth that ſhee may up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; which contempt and neglect of the things below, it is a ſigne wee ſeeke the things of heaven, and though our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108344:120"/> be on earth that wee hold our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in heaven, where wee looke and fix our eyes through all earthly contentments. Wee ſhould be on earth as a wheele is, that though it moove upon the earth; yet the leaſt part toucheth it.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> That is the firſt; if wee will ſeeke the things above, wee muſt not too eagerly ſeeke the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <note place="margin">Sorrow in want of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</note>Secondly, if wee ſeeke the things above can wee chooſe but bee affected with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and compunction when wee want them? It is not poſſible: hee that ſeekes theſe things above as hee ought, when hee findes in himſelfe the want and decay of them, it is impoſſible but hee ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelfe to blacke, to a mourning ſtate. You ſee the truth of this exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>David,</hi> when hee upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mition of thoſe two ſinnes, murder and adultery, hee found hee was bereft of the comfortable preſence of Gods favour, he furrowes his cheekes with weeping, and ſpends himſelfe, his marrow was as the <hi>drought in Summer,</hi> hee never gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe reſt till God revived, and cheared his drouping ſoule, and cauſed the beames of his countenance to ſmile upon him. So it is with a man that ſeekes the things that are above, in the want of them hee is as the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108344:120"/> Marriners needle,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as that is in the want of the point, ſo are all thoſe that <hi>ſeeke the things above</hi> in the want of them, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſt but ſhake and tremble till at laſt they recover them and ſtand as they did formerly. That is the ſecond argument whereby wee may know if wee ſeeke theſe things, if wee grieve and mourne when wee want them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if wee <hi>ſeeke theſe things above;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <note place="margin">Ioy in injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</note> how can wee chuſe but rejoyce when wee find them: for Love where it is it cannot chooſe but bee glad when it findes that it delights in. Take an inſtance of both in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith hee,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.</note> 
                  <hi>whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none in earth in compariſon of thee.</hi> Marke there, <hi>David</hi> deſired theſe things above, and when his ſoule found them, his ſoule loved them. Who can reade it, and not bee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed to ſee to what an exceſſive extacie of joy hee was tranſported?<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.</note> hee preferred the light of Gods countenance, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 4. before all the Corne and Wine, and Oyle, the poore things that worldlings place their chiefe content in.</p>
               <p>But in the laſt place, what neede other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> things (to reſolve whether wee ſeeke the things above or no) but this?<note place="margin">By our thoughts and ſpeeches.</note> our owne thoughts are the image of our ſoules, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:108344:121"/> our words are the image of our thoughts; hee that ſeekes theſe things above as hee ought, he cannot but make them the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject of the one, and the frequent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other.</p>
               <p>And here, were our breſts tranſparent, and our thoughts written in Characters, Lord! for one thought that wee ſpend on things above, how many thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand do ewee ſpend about the profits and pleaſures, nay about our ſinfull luſts! Or if wee thinke they lye hid in the ſecrecie, and reſervedneſſe of our thoughts; alas our language betrayes us: how rare a matter is it for heaven to bee made the theame of our diſcourſe? If our hearts did runne full to the things above, they could not chuſe but often over-runne the bankes. And theſe are the Characters whereby wee may take the height of our thoughts, and know whether wee ſeeke the things above or no.</p>

                  </label> 
                  <note place="margin">Exhortation to ſeeke theſe things.</note>I conclude all with one word of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The beſt things when they come to bee degenerate, and to turne edge they become the worſt. Man, the glory and Paragon of the creatures, tranſgreſſing the the law of his maker, though hee loſt the whole world in his owne ruine and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, yet hee drew the greateſt weight of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:108344:121"/> miſery upon himſelfe. For whereas all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures by the ſole diſcipline of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeeke perfection, and the thing it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in, Man onely bands againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and ſtands in neede of wooing. Alas that wee ſhould neede to bee ſolicited to ſeeke the <hi>things above,</hi> that wee cannot finde except wee ſeeke, and are eternally loſt our ſelves except wee finde. The truth is, theſe are ſeeking times, as indeede what times are not? ſome ſeeke pleaſure, ſome profit, ſome honour, a fourth is for favour, and ſo the reſt; among all which, ſet but aſide our paſſion, and prepoſeſſed thoughts, and what ſhall wee ſee in them to command our affections or deſerve them? What is pleaſure, but a ſilken hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that if wee looke not well to, will ſtrangle us in the imbracing? What are riches, (but as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they bee in a wiſe and wary hand) agents and Pandors to execute our luſts? As the ſame ſame Father ſaith, Gold is clay that wee can hardly handle without ſoyling of us. What is honour but a glorious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, a pleaſant diſcontent? What is fame, but a windie meteor wrapped upon high which in a while vaniſheth and comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Suppoſe a man wanted the things above, and were placed amidſt the conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108344:122"/> of all the contentments below: Nay ſuppoſt hee wanted one of theſe things <hi>above,</hi> the peace of conſcience, the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the remiſſion of his ſinnes; I ſay, place that man amidſt the confluence of all contentments below, and ſee how miſerable his caſe would bee. Let his cup overflow with <hi>Belſhazer,</hi> let the whole world pay tribute to his Table, let him get mountaines of Gold and Silver, and let all the world be bur one Exchequer; let him trample on Crownes and Scepters, and let all the Kings and Princes doe him homage, and at his frowne let the earth tremble and move. Here were content enough you would thinke; But let this man want one thing, the peace of conſcience, and ſee how ſoone all theſe contentments vaniſh as the dew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sunne. Let but God awaken this man out of his deceitfull ſlumber, and bid his conſcience muſter his ſinnes, and ſet them before him in their gaſtly ſhape; let him give it charge to take him and as an earneſt of his future torments ſhake him over the pit that one day hee muſt tumble headlong in, I ſay how ſoon wil his contentments vaniſh? How frayle are they in his greateſt neede. If hee call for Gold, conſcience will not be bribed; if hee ſolace himſelfe with royall banquets, conſcience as an unwelcome gueſt dogges
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:108344:122"/> him, or as that diſmal ſummons that appeared to <hi>Belſhazer</hi> diſreliſheth all the reſt. Let him ſettle his temples with a Crowne of Gold, and take the royall Scepter into his hand, conſcience is like a maſter that will know no partner, and acknowledge no commander. So all things here in our greateſt height they are unſound, but in our chiefeſt neede they are falſe and trecherous.</p>
               <p>Our wiſedome therefore ought to bee in the middeſt of the infinite varietie of theſe objects, in the purſuite of them, to ſpeed our ſelves, to be ſure to get ſomewhat that will quit our charge, that will ſtand us in ſtead here, and comfort us hereafter. And can there bee a fayrer object for our ſeeking then grace and glory, called here the <hi>things above?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who would not thinke grace worth the ſeeking? to bee reconciled to God, to bee freed from the power and dominion of ſinne, to have our ſoules inriched with heavenly graces, and our ſelues inherit a Crowne of glory? All which fruits of grace muſt here be ſought, and may be found. But what is there below? How much better is it to goe up to the things above, as the Angell did to heaven in the flame of the Altar?</p>
               <p>O Lord wee cannot ſeeke the things above till wee have found them, and when
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108344:123"/> wee have found them wee muſt ſtill ſeeke them: thou by thy preventing grace muſt inable us to ſeeke, and by thy grace alſo give us ſucceſſe to finde. Lord wee pray thee open our eyes that wee may ſeeke the things above, and then let us finde them. Say <hi>Lord, ſeeke yee my face, and thy face Lord will wee ſeeke.</hi> And if wee ſeeke thy face here then wee ſhall bee ſatisfied hereafter with thine Image. And ſo ſatisfie ſtill our deſires, and ſo deſire wee that wee may not want what wee can deſire, till we be ſwallowed up of that Ocean of happineſſe, and looſe our ſelves in enjoying of thee.</p>
               <p>But if all this will not ſtirre us, there is ſomewhat yet that will, let us looke further with <hi>Moſes</hi> eye to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. I ſay let us looke further, take the perſpective of our faith, &amp; view thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crownes, and Scepters, and long white robes, the garments of Chriſts victory, reſerved in heaven for all thoſe that in the meanes of grace here <hi>ſeeke thoſe things that are above,</hi> and an entrance into glory. When wee finde our ſelves dull in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things above, let us betake our ſelves upon the wing in a flight to heaven, and there bathe our ſoules in thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that runne in a full Channell at Gods right hand for ever. If wee taſte but one
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:108344:123"/> drop of them wee ſhould diſtaſte all the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſweets below. Let us goe to God with thoſe glorious Quereſters, and beare a part in thoſe ſweete Hymmes, and ſay thus, <hi>Glory, and honour, and power, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and might, and majeſtie, and dominion bee to our Lord, and to the Lambe that ſits upon the Throne for ever, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, even ſo</hi> Amen. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>
